Initially, the absorption of toxic metal ions is limited by cell membrane exclusion. Ions that are absorbed into tissues are sequestered in cell vacuoles. This sequestration mechanism is facilitated by proteins on the vacuole membrane.Chemical priming has been proposed to increase tolerance to abiotic stresses in crop plants. In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: In a greenhouse, a botanist has just finished planting two of the same kind of plant.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920â21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

While Underwood is no fan of President Donald Trump, she said her No. 1 concern â and the top concern of the voters she hopes to will send her to Washington â is access to health care. Attacking the Republican president hard just isnât necessarily a winning play in Illinoisâ 14th congressional district, said Underwood, who served as an adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services under Democratic President Barack Obama. âI donât talk about him that much. He has a higher approval rating than my congressman does, so we talk about our congressman,â said Underwood, whoâs hoping to oust incumbent Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren in a district that narrowly backed Trump two years ago. Other Democrats aiming to flip House seats say theyâre also trying to zero in on policy more than the president. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has its hopes pinned on 50-plus candidates looking to upend enough seats â 23 â to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP for the first time in eight years. Republicans have their own plan to retain control, but Democrats are banking they have more than just both momentum and history on their side. U.S. Rep. Denny Heck is helping lead the effort to flip the House. The Washington Democrat said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee can assist candidates with a range of tasks â from tapping into a national donor base to aiding with the basic mechanics of building a campaign. But he warned that trash-talking Trump will get a candidate only so far. âWhat candidates ought to be doing is talking about that crowded freeway that they need to get additional funds to widen or additional funds to provide mass transit for, or that lake that is becoming polluted and they need the EPA to step up,â Heck said. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is also on the âRed to Blueâ list. Mucarsel-Powell, who came from Ecuador as an immigrant with her mother, said Floridaâs 26th Congressional District â the stateâs southernmost district â is one of the most vulnerable for Republicans in the country. She pointed to a 16-point win by Hillary Clinton there in 2016. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo. While Mucarsel-Powell doesnât shy away from talking about Trump, she says sheâs more focused on the struggles of local residents. âThey donât have access to health care. They donât have good quality education,â she said, adding that tens of thousands depend on the Obama 2010 health care law that Republicans have worked to undo. Talk of a Democratic blue wave is overblown, according to Matt Gorman, communication director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said the committee â which has its own âYoung Gunsâ program â is raising impressive sums and has battle-tested incumbents who know theyâre going to be targets. Gorman said the NRCC is also urging candidates to run on local issues and not focus on the latest headlines on cable new or Twitter. He said polling shows the party is in better shape than many assume. âThis is going to be a fight and certainly weâre going to work like weâre 10 points down as we do every day, but for the bedwetters out there who are claiming that all hope is loss I would encourage them to actually look at the data,â he said. âItâs simple math.â Democratic Rep. Katherine Clark, who is also heading up the DCCCâs âRed to Blueâ initiative, said many candidates sheâs been working with are more eager to dig into whatâs on the minds of voters than taking swipes at Trump. âTheyâre not concerned with talking about Donald Trump as much as they are about talking about how people in their communities want their children to have job opportunities in the communities that they grew up in,â Clark said. While defeating Trump may galvanize the Democratic faithful, the party is still fumbling for a wider unifying message, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor and former political media consultant. And Democrats may have trouble finding issues, local or not, for voters to latch onto in November. âThe problem is that unemployment is low, economic confidence is relatively high, so to tell people youâve never had it so bad when compared to eight years ago theyâve got it pretty good, thatâs sort of also a tough road to hoe,â he said. âThe Democrats may have history on the side. The question is A, will they blow it? And B, is Trump such an anomaly that history is being rewritten?â Roxane Pirayesh, a 32-year-old from Sacramento, California, who works for an education nonprofit, said in the end, the pitch from Democrats has to be more than just an anti-Trump drumbeat â and sheâs not sure everyoneâs gotten the message. âI think thatâs probably the biggest flaw coming out of the Democratic Party,â she said.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: my teacher be the great and the great mean the best she do n't like to be mean neither see be mean thats why i call her the best\nTask 3 output: He is a Republican"}, {"instruction": "Generate a title for an article based on its abstract. and then Extract RDF triplets from the given article title. and then Generate a sentence describing a day-to-day scene using the extracted RDF triplets.", "input": "Glioblastomas are deadly cancers that display a functional cellular hierarchy maintained by self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Targeting A20 Decreases Glioma Stem Cell Survival and Tumor Growth\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['The Waterman', 'food', 'French'], ['The Waterman', 'priceRange', 'less than Â£20'], ['The Waterman', 'customer rating', 'average'], ['The Waterman', 'area', 'riverside'], ['The Waterman', 'familyFriendly', 'yes']]\nTask 3 output: The dog is wagging his tail."}, {"instruction": "Correct the given English sentence. and then Extract RDF triplets from the given sentence. and then Fill in the blank in the given RDF triplets with one of the two objects mentioned in the RDF triplets.", "input": "finally the third cause that birds use a type of internal compass , birds have crystals of the mineral magetite embedded in their break .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Finally , the third piece of evidence that birds use a type of internal compass is that birds have crystals of the mineral magnetite embedded in their break .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University', 'CITY', 'Aarhus'], ['School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University', 'COUNTRY', 'Denmark'], ['Aarhus', 'HAS_TO_ITS_NORTHEAST', 'Mols'], ['Denmark', 'LEADER_NAME', 'Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen']]\nTask 3 output: salad"}, {"instruction": "Decompose a yes/no question into a series of sub-questions that can be answered using Wikipedia articles.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its OsÃ© robotic âpersonal massager.â Itâs one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad âbooth babes,â fostering a âboysâ clubâ reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official âequality partner,â The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. âItâs been a process,â said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. Itâs been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startupsâ female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Craveâs exhibit included a camper with a âBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,â where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other âfem techâ companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. âLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,â said Barrica, who recently published the book âSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.â Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasnât been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. âItâs entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,â she said. Founders insist that their devices â ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories â have effects outside the bedroom. âSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,â said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. âIt does way more than just pleasure. Itâs immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.â DiCarloâs $290 OsÃ© device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed âimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTAâs image.â DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new âInnovation for Allâ sessions with senior diversity officials. OsÃ© began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. âThings are better, but thereâs just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,â she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ APâs CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The US has remembered the victims of the 9/11 attacks in a series of memorials marking the 12th anniversary.\nTask 3 output: lata mondal"}, {"instruction": "Elaborate the given sentence by providing more details, using specific language, and adding additional information without changing the overall meaning. and then Summarize the article in one sentence based on the elaborated sentence. and then Complete the story by predicting the appropriate last sentence.", "input": "It is in San Diego County , California next to Oceanside , San Clemente , Cleveland National Forest , Orange County , Riverside County and Fallbrook .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: It is on the Southern California coast , in San Diego County , and bordered by Oceanside to the south , Cleveland National Forest , San Clemente , and Orange County to the north , Riverside County to the northeast , and Fallbrook to the east .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A 20-year-old man has been charged with two counts of attempted murder after two shootings in Newry, County Down, last month.\nTask 3 output: Jim took time to decide what he would take a picture of."}, {"instruction": "Correct the grammar errors in the given sentence. and then Summarize the article in one sentence using the corrected sentence. and then Generate a story based on the given article summary.", "input": "['now', 'that', 'we', 'understand', 'ortho-para', 'directors', \"let's\", 'take', 'a', 'look', 'at', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'a', 'meta', 'director', 'and', 'so', 'we', 'start', 'with', 'nitrobenzene', 'and', 'if', 'our', 'goal', 'is', 'to', 'nitrate', 'nitrobenzene', 'alright', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'add', 'something', 'like', 'fuming', 'nitric', 'acid', 'sulfuric', 'acid', 'as', 'our', 'catalyst', 'and', 'we', 'also', 'need', 'to', 'heat', 'it', 'up', 'so', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'force', 'this', 'reaction', 'to', 'occur', 'because', 'nitro', 'benzene', 'turns', 'out', 'to', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'reactive', 'as', 'benzene', 'itself', 'and', 'so', 'the', 'end', 'result', 'is', 'to', 'add', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the', 'meta', 'position', 'right', 'so', 'we', 'added', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the']", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: ['Now', 'that', 'we', 'understand', 'ortho/para', 'directors,', \"let's\", 'take', 'a', 'look', 'at', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'a', 'meta', 'director.', 'And', 'so', 'we', 'start', 'with', 'nitrobenzene.', 'And', 'if', 'our', 'goal', 'is', 'to', 'nitrate', 'nitrobenzene', 'alright', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'add', 'something', 'like', 'fuming', 'nitric', 'acid,', 'sulfuric', 'acid', 'as', 'our', 'catalyst,', 'and', 'we', 'also', 'need', 'to', 'heat', 'it', 'up.', 'So', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'force', 'this', 'reaction', 'to', 'occur', 'because', 'nitro', 'benzene', 'turns', 'out', 'to', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'reactive', 'as', 'benzene', 'itself.', 'And', 'so', 'the', 'end', 'result', 'is', 'to', 'add', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'into', 'the', 'meta', 'position', 'right', 'so', 'we', 'added', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the']\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Sir Michael Rake, deputy chairman of Barclays, has ruled himself out of the running to become the bank's chairman.\nTask 3 output: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920â21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

Gamblers \"Sleepy\" Bill Burns and Billy Maharg get wind of the players' discontent, asking shady player Chick Gandil to convince a select group of Soxâincluding star knuckleball pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who led the majors with a 29â7 winâloss record and an earned run average of 1.82âthat they could earn more money by playing badly and throwing the series than they could earn by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds . Cicotte was motivated because Comiskey refused him a promised $10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) with the excuse that the 35-year-old veteran's arm needed a rest before the series.

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firmâs at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. âHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do. We have a test ready to submit,â she said. âWe need to get our test approved, and theyâre not giving us an option of how to get it approved.â   BioSure has been producing an at-home HIV test since 2015, and Bard met Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March to discuss her COVID-19 test. At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. âThere will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,â she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. âIf our test fails the validation, then itâs not fit to go to market,â she said. âIâm happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.â Claim: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: British regulators will this week reveal approval criteria for firms offering new coronavirus antibody tests, touted by governments in Britain and elsewhere as critical to easing nationwide lockdowns without helping the virus to spread.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: After Alexander's death, the territory was divided among his generals, whose ambitions and antagonism led exposed Anatolia to the might of Rome.\nTask 3 output: (1, 2)"}, {"instruction": "Complete the story by predicting the appropriate last sentence. and then Generate a story based on the predicted last sentence. and then Identify the word with a typo in the story.", "input": "Sentence1: Tony was happy to be going on his first cruise.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: 12 - hour clock times end with dotted or undotted lower-case or, or or, which are spaced.\nTask 3 output: True"}, {"instruction": "Write an SQL statement based on an English description of what the SQL statement does. and then Generate a poem related to the given SQL statement, written in a simple and childlike manner.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: ['If', 'you', 'roll', 'a', 'six-sided', 'die', 'and', 'a', 'four-sided', 'die,', 'what', 'is', 'the', 'probability', 'that', 'neither', 'die', 'shows', 'a', '1?', 'The', 'grid', 'below', 'shows', 'all', 'the', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'of', 'rolling', 'a', 'six-sided', 'die', 'and', 'a', 'four-sided', 'die.', 'And', \"we're\", 'fairly', 'familiar', 'with', 'six-sided', 'die.', 'Those', 'are', 'the', 'cubes', 'that', \"we're\", 'used', 'to', 'from', 'the', 'board', 'games', 'that', \"we've\", 'been', 'playing', 'our', 'entire', 'lives,', 'that', 'look', 'something', 'like', 'that.', 'And', 'your', 'roll', 'is', 'whatever', 'is', 'the', 'face-up', \"you're\", 'probably', 'less', 'familiar', 'with', 'four-sided', 'die.', 'These', 'are', 'more', 'of', 'like', 'these', 'these', 'triangular', 'pyramids.', 'They', 'look', 'something', 'like', 'this.', 'So', 'it', 'has']\nTask 3 output: 0"}, {"instruction": "Create a pair of sentences that clearly contradict each other.

Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, \"the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\"Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava 100 m (330 ft) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Moreover, the reference in paragraph three to paying, quote, the house rent on the second, end quote,\nTask 3 output: True"}, {"instruction": "Generate a question based on a list of triplets, replacing the subject and/or object with blanks. and then Provide a justification for the coreference between a pronoun and a noun phrase in the generated question.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A battle between German and Danish forces took place near the town on April 23 1849 during the First War of Schleswig.\nTask 3 output: How do the Yamacraw Island inhabitants say the name of Jon Voight's character?"}, {"instruction": "Provide a justification for the coreference between a pronoun and a noun phrase in a sentence.

Speaking as he presented his two latest signings, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind, Van Gaal explained why Welbeck, 23, was sold to Arsenal for Â£16m. \"He played three seasons for the first team, but he doesn't have the record of Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney. And that is the standard,\" Van Gaal said. \"That is why we let him go, because of Falcao, but also to allow the youngsters to fit in. That is the policy. That is why I am here.\" Welbeck joined Arsenal on transfer deadline day in a deal Gunners manager Arsene Wenger revealed almost did not happen. The Manchester-born forward, who scored both goals for England in Monday's 2-0 victory over Switzerland, netted 29 times in 142 United appearances. Welbeck's international team-mate Rooney, 28, has scored 217 goals for United in 445 matches, while Dutchman van Persie, 31, has hit 48 in 78 games. United spent close to Â£150m during a summer transfer spree, but also allowed a large number of players to leave. Van Gaal said promoting local young players was a cornerstone of his philosophy at Old Trafford. \"We let 14 players go, we have only brought six players in,\" he added. \"That means there are many positions vacant, they are vacant for the youth. \"I have already used a lot of youngsters in the season and pre-season, so I am always willing to give young players chances - but they have to take the chances. \"The possibility is there. All the youngsters have to know that.\" Much of the attention during Thursday's news conference focused on Falcao. The Colombia striker hinted he wanted to stay at United beyond his season-long loan from Monaco, with the Old Trafford club having an option to buy him for Â£44m (55m euros) in the summer. \"This is a new process, a new team,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I would like to be here and part of his project. Every player wants to play Champions League. \"This year it is not possible in Manchester, but we are confident to achieve the qualification for the next season.\" Van Gaal praised Falcao, adding he believed he could lift United to new heights. \"When you see his record, it is unbelievable,\" he said. \"Today in the training session, he got one ball and it was in the goal. \"When I say this I put too much pressure on him, I know it is very difficult to come from another club to Manchester United in a new process.\"", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal says striker Danny Welbeck was sold because he did not score enough goals.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: male\nTask 3 output: The Civil Registry and Identification Service is the Chilean public service in charge of registering civil statuses of persons and other issues which , by law , it has to register ."}, {"instruction": "Generate a story based on the given prompt. and then Summarize the story in one sentence. and then Complete the story by predicting the appropriate last sentence of the story.", "input": "Background Paragraph: Serpentine soils (media with low concentrations of nutrients and high concentrations of heavy metals) can be a source of abiotic stress.

While Underwood is no fan of President Donald Trump, she said her No. 1 concern â and the top concern of the voters she hopes to will send her to Washington â is access to health care. Attacking the Republican president hard just isnât necessarily a winning play in Illinoisâ 14th congressional district, said Underwood, who served as an adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services under Democratic President Barack Obama. âI donât talk about him that much. He has a higher approval rating than my congressman does, so we talk about our congressman,â said Underwood, whoâs hoping to oust incumbent Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren in a district that narrowly backed Trump two years ago. Other Democrats aiming to flip House seats say theyâre also trying to zero in on policy more than the president. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has its hopes pinned on 50-plus candidates looking to upend enough seats â 23 â to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP for the first time in eight years. Republicans have their own plan to retain control, but Democrats are banking they have more than just both momentum and history on their side. U.S. Rep. Denny Heck is helping lead the effort to flip the House. The Washington Democrat said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee can assist candidates with a range of tasks â from tapping into a national donor base to aiding with the basic mechanics of building a campaign. But he warned that trash-talking Trump will get a candidate only so far. âWhat candidates ought to be doing is talking about that crowded freeway that they need to get additional funds to widen or additional funds to provide mass transit for, or that lake that is becoming polluted and they need the EPA to step up,â Heck said. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is also on the âRed to Blueâ list. Mucarsel-Powell, who came from Ecuador as an immigrant with her mother, said Floridaâs 26th Congressional District â the stateâs southernmost district â is one of the most vulnerable for Republicans in the country. She pointed to a 16-point win by Hillary Clinton there in 2016. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo. While Mucarsel-Powell doesnât shy away from talking about Trump, she says sheâs more focused on the struggles of local residents. âThey donât have access to health care. They donât have good quality education,â she said, adding that tens of thousands depend on the Obama 2010 health care law that Republicans have worked to undo. Talk of a Democratic blue wave is overblown, according to Matt Gorman, communication director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said the committee â which has its own âYoung Gunsâ program â is raising impressive sums and has battle-tested incumbents who know theyâre going to be targets. Gorman said the NRCC is also urging candidates to run on local issues and not focus on the latest headlines on cable new or Twitter. He said polling shows the party is in better shape than many assume. âThis is going to be a fight and certainly weâre going to work like weâre 10 points down as we do every day, but for the bedwetters out there who are claiming that all hope is loss I would encourage them to actually look at the data,â he said. âItâs simple math.â Democratic Rep. Katherine Clark, who is also heading up the DCCCâs âRed to Blueâ initiative, said many candidates sheâs been working with are more eager to dig into whatâs on the minds of voters than taking swipes at Trump. âTheyâre not concerned with talking about Donald Trump as much as they are about talking about how people in their communities want their children to have job opportunities in the communities that they grew up in,â Clark said. While defeating Trump may galvanize the Democratic faithful, the party is still fumbling for a wider unifying message, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor and former political media consultant. And Democrats may have trouble finding issues, local or not, for voters to latch onto in November. âThe problem is that unemployment is low, economic confidence is relatively high, so to tell people youâve never had it so bad when compared to eight years ago theyâve got it pretty good, thatâs sort of also a tough road to hoe,â he said. âThe Democrats may have history on the side. The question is A, will they blow it? And B, is Trump such an anomaly that history is being rewritten?â Roxane Pirayesh, a 32-year-old from Sacramento, California, who works for an education nonprofit, said in the end, the pitch from Democrats has to be more than just an anti-Trump drumbeat â and sheâs not sure everyoneâs gotten the message. âI think thatâs probably the biggest flaw coming out of the Democratic Party,â she said.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: on one friday night i be walk outside the thunder howl and the rain pour i walk down mulberry street but could n't open my door the tree sway and the leaf rustle i be terrify and begin to hustle i run back up the road to my neighbor's house i find my dad but not his spouse he hand me key so i could get into the door but i drop the key and they land on the floor i pick them up and run down the street and on my front porch i find a monster he really give me the creep he begin to chase me and i run into the house then he come in and sleep on the couch i wake up the next morning to see if he be still there i find out i be dream and i do n't really care\nTask 3 output: (2, 3)"}, {"instruction": "Write an SQL statement based on an English description of what the SQL statement does. and then Generate a poem related to the given SQL statement, written in a simple and childlike manner.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920â21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the last name of the person who is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Heseltine.\nTask 3 output: Several ways we can reach the balance of our target principal.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416â359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359â299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions.

Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['The Waterman', 'eatType', 'restaurant'], ['The Waterman', 'food', 'Chinese'], ['The Waterman', 'priceRange', 'high'], ['The Waterman', 'customer rating', '1 out of 5'], ['The Waterman', 'area', 'riverside'], ['The Waterman', 'familyFriendly', 'no']]\nTask 3 output: False"}, {"instruction": "Generate a natural language interpretation of a given command involving logical operations on a table. and then Answer questions about the natural language interpretation with multiple references to the same entity.

There was no discussion in the story about whether there are different costs associated with the procedure itself. The story explained that the through-the-wrist approach was associated with lower risk of bleeding and shorter hospitalizations but should have included a caveat explanation about the strength of research and that the results of the study reported on require follow-up investigation. The story mentioned risk of bleeding at the site of catheter insertion as a possible harm of treatment which was greater for those who had a the catheter inserted in the leg. To its credit, the story provided absolute risk information, i.e. pointing out the 60% reduction in bleeding was the difference between 2 and 1% of patients having this complication. The story did not mention whether there were any particular side effects or harms associated with catheter insertion at the wrist. The story explained that the study was an analysis of information contained within a national registry. But it should have explained that this is the weakest type of study from which to draw a clinical conclusion (such as this procedure is safer or as safe as the alternative). Thus the statement in the story âboth methods were equally effectiveâ should have been more tentative. The underlying weakness of the study, that it is not a controlled trial, may mean that the patients who had the wrist approach had something else about them that helped to reduce risk and that the researchers may not have been able to take into consideration. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included interview material from one clinician who was not associated with the study reported on. The quality of the piece would have been improved if it had included input from physicians who might have explained some of the reasons why not all interventional cardiologists use the wrist approach. The story did an adequate job of reporting about a recent study comparing two approaches to angioplasty. The story indicated that the angioplasty using access through the wrist as opposed to a leg, was used much less frequently.vThe story explained that extra training is required in order to use this procedure and many doctors are not trained in this technique. This would contribute to the procedureâs limited availability. The story did a good job of explaining that neither of the two approaches compared were new and that the point of the study was to determine how the two sites compare in terms of their use.

However â the story should have included some insight about the strength of the observation obtained from the current study. As it was not a controlled study â so it did not evaluate the two procedures in a controlled environment â any predictions are tentative and require further examination.

Answer True if all punctuation is correct, otherwise answer False.", "input": "Background: Infectious disease surveillance is a process the product of which reflects both actual disease trends and public awareness of the disease. Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: More than Â£300,000 has been raised for the project that was tracking Cecil the lion, since his death last month.\nTask 3 output: True"}, {"instruction": "Decompose a yes/no question into a series of sub-questions that can be answered using Wikipedia articles.

account. my so is a reddit user, and while she doesn't get on tifu, better safe than sorry for now.  alright, as per usual, this happened 3 days ago. there is this homeless guy named daniel, i can him dan, and he lives/hangsout in an area that is on my way to work. i only work about 15 min from home and walk as much as i can to save on gas money. i started my relationship with dan by helping him out one day. i threw him a few bucks and gave him most of my lunch one day and struck up a conversation. he told me about his divorce and how he lost everything and i felt really bad this guy had been dealt a shit hand and how i myself could use a friend if i was in his situation. so over the past handful of months i have been helping him out any way i could in the mornings on my way to work, whether it be throwing him a couple bucks every week or making 2 lunches in the morning, one for me and one for him. he always seemed like a righteous dude down on his luck, and even though i'm not even middle class, i live in a tiny 1 bedroom apartment, i figured the least i could do is kinda help the guy out.  so three days ago my so grabs my wallet and stuffs a hundred dollar bill in my wallet and asks me to get a money order to put towards our rent after i get off work right as i'm getting up in the morning. in my typical morning haze, i agree. do my morning routine, make an extra sandwich for dan, and head out. i find dan sitting in his usual spot and go up to chit chat with him for a min and hand him the sandwich and pull out my wallet. i don't normally hand over cash to him super often, but when i know i have a few extra bucks to spare, i'd hook him up. i knew i had a couple bucks extra today so i grabbed them outta my wallet and gave it to him. he thanked me profusely like he typically did and i was off to work.  later in the day i get a text from my so reminding me to get the money order when i got off and my blood ran so cold it made my nipples hard. i knew i had cleaned my wallet out for dan that morning and thought i only had like 3 bucks forgetting i had a hundred dollar bill in there for rent. i reassured myself that i could talk to dan after work and hopefully get most of my money back and apologize to him. haven't seen the dude since that morning.  i haven't told my so yet but i decided to have a talk with my land lord about it and explain what was going on. found out she is a complete and utter bitch. she told me, and i quote, \"this is a life lesson. you shouldn't help drug addicted alcoholic homeless people. rent is due the same time as every month.\" i am just utterly floored and broken. i fear i'm going to be evicted becuase i most likely won't have that cash before the late period ends. now i have to break the news to my so...     i think there is an alanis morissette song that would go along with this tifu.   edit: told my so about what happened and she was very upset. basically told me i was irresponsible and couldn't believe

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920â21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its OsÃ© robotic âpersonal massager.â Itâs one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad âbooth babes,â fostering a âboysâ clubâ reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official âequality partner,â The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. âItâs been a process,â said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. Itâs been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startupsâ female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Craveâs exhibit included a camper with a âBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,â where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other âfem techâ companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. âLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,â said Barrica, who recently published the book âSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.â Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasnât been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. âItâs entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,â she said. Founders insist that their devices â ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories â have effects outside the bedroom. âSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,â said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. âIt does way more than just pleasure. Itâs immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.â DiCarloâs $290 OsÃ© device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed âimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTAâs image.â DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new âInnovation for Allâ sessions with senior diversity officials. OsÃ© began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. âThings are better, but thereâs just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,â she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ APâs CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The US has remembered the victims of the 9/11 attacks in a series of memorials marking the 12th anniversary.\nTask 3 output: No."}, {"instruction": "Summarize the article in one sentence. and then Extract RDF triplets from the given article summary. and then Select the correct answer option for the extracted RDF triplets.", "input": "Sir Michael had been considered the frontrunner to replace the incumbent, Marcus Agius. Mr Agius quit earlier this month due to the Libor fixing scandal, but then had to take on the running of the company following the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined ÃÂ£290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. In summary, our studies suggest that GW3965 inhibits NDV infection, probably by affecting cholesterol homeostasis.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: The LXR ligand GW3965 inhibits Newcastle disease virus infection by affecting cholesterol homeostasis\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A man put two cups, cup A and cup B, filled with equal amounts of water on to a table and walked away to go check his mail.

In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: In a greenhouse, a botanist has just finished planting two of the same kind of plant.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416â359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359â299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.

The company is facing some 11,700 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products. Leavittâs lawyer, Joseph Satterley, accused J&J in his opening statement of knowingly selling a dangerous product, according to an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. âThe evidence will show that J&J knew about the asbestos risk and they continued to sell the product, giving consumers no opportunity to protect themselves,â he said. A lawyer for co-defendant Imerys Talc America, a unit of French Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), told the jury the evidence would show there is no asbestos in its talc and that Leavittâs disease was not caused by its product. A lawyer for J&J will make his opening remarks on Tuesday. âOur talc is safe and does not contain asbestos. For decades, Johnson & Johnsonâs Baby Powder has repeatedly been tested and been found not to contain asbestos,â the company said in response to a request for comment on Monday. J&J and Imerys have argued in court that decades of studies have shown their products to be safe and asbestos-free. Leavittâs is the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing internal J&J documents showing talc in the companyâs raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. The report prompted a stock selloff on fears of J&Jâs liability. Shares on Monday closed at $127.01, 14 percent below their Dec. 13 value. While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffsâ lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Leavittâs case is being tried by the same team of lawyers, including Satterley, who in April 2018 won a $117 million award by a New Jersey jury for a man who blamed his mesothelioma on J&Jâs cosmetic talc. That verdict is under appeal. In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal. Leavitt was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. She was born in the Philippines and claims she was exposed to J&J cosmetic talc that originated from South Korea mines during the first two years of her life before her parents moved back to the United States in 1968, Satterley said on Monday. He said testing of Asian talc samples from the 1960s and 1970s by his own expert would show Korean-mined talc tested positive for asbestos fibers, as has talc from U.S. sources. J&J in court filings in the Leavitt case said that fibers found in the Korean talc or any of its other cosmetic talc could not be classified as asbestos and referred to them as non-asbestos forms that its experts say are harmless. Geologically, some asbestos can occur as ânon-asbestiformâ rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits. The company in its Monday statement did not specifically address the allegations surrounding the South Korean mine.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416â359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359â299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['Bobby Jackson', 'POSITION', 'G']]\nTask 3 output: Find information on hip fractures in the elderly."}, {"instruction": "Extract RDF triplets from the given sentence. and then Fix the SQL query based on feedback from the RDF triplets. and then Correct the grammar errors in the fixed SQL query.", "input": "Bobby Jackson is a guard.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: [['Bobby Jackson', 'POSITION', 'G']]\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: SELECT name FROM program WHERE origin != 'Beijing'\nTask 3 output: [\"let's\", 'talk', 'about', 'the', '0th', 'Law', 'of', 'Thermodynamics.', 'Now', 'the', '0th', 'law,', \"it's\", 'a', 'strange', 'one.', 'For', 'one,', \"it's\", 'called', 'the', '0th', 'law', 'and', \"that's\", 'kind', 'of', 'weird.', \"We'll\", 'talk', 'about', 'why', 'in', 'a', 'minute.', 'And', 'for', 'two,', 'when', 'you', 'hear', 'the', 'actual', 'statement', 'of', 'the', '0th', 'law,', 'it', 'sounds', 'so', 'obvious', 'and', 'trivial,', 'you', 'think', \"it's\", 'kind', 'of', 'stupid', 'to', 'have', 'a', 'law', 'for', 'in', 'fact', 'when', 'I', 'first', 'heard', 'it,', 'I', 'thought', 'it', 'was', 'pretty', 'dumb,', 'but', 'now', 'that', 'I', 'know', 'a', 'little', 'more,', \"it's\", 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'trivial', 'as', 'I', 'thought', 'it', 'was', 'and', \"I'll\", 'try', 'to']"}, {"instruction": "Correct the given English sentence. and then Write a compressed version of the given text in one sentence. and then Simplify the compressed sentence to make it easier for non-native English speakers to understand.", "input": "For example , nobody is going to ask his personal doctor which he sees when he has a flue if he can also do a heart surgery or transplant organs .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: For example , nobody is going to ask his personal doctor , which he sees when he has a flu , if he can also do a heart surgery or transplant organs .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: \"Barnes and Noble permits browsing, rather than forcing their tightwadded cappuccinoed customers to buy their books.\"\nTask 3 output: By the early 1600s, brick and tile were being made on a small scale.

While public health experts are demanding bolder action, most governors and mayors have not imposed mandatory stay-at-home orders. Their apparent reluctance comes amid Bolsonaroâs relentless message for Brazilians to defy regional and local public health efforts to stop the virusâ spread. Stricter lockdowns are needed because Brazilian doctors are now being forced to choose who lives and dies and triage situations could generate social unrest if they increase, said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazilâs non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. âWe need to avoid a total disaster,â he said. Lago said mandatory lockdowns across much of the country would help: âIt is late in terms of avoiding hospital collapse, but certainly it isnât too late to avoid a bigger catastrophe.â Brazil had more than 177,000 confirmed cases on Tuesday, with the actual figure believed to be much higher because of limited testing. Many intensive care hospital units are full and cemeteries are increasingly overwhelmed with bodies. Bolsonaro, who called the virus a âlittle flu,â has insisted for more than a month that governors are stoking economic carnage with voluntary quarantine recommendations and urges Brazilians to go about their everyday. He reiterated criticism of governors Tuesday for ignoring his decree that gyms, barbershops and beauty salons should be treated as essential services. Amid Bolsonaroâs rejection of coronavirus danger, most of the countryâs 27 governors have criticized his stances but none have imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, the governors have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or deferred to mayors to make those decisions. Governors had been hoping the virus would not spread in Brazilâs warm climate, but their response is also a reflection of Brazilâs political landscape because the governors depend on mayors to endorse re-election campaigns. Many worry that imposing mandatory lockdowns could hurt local leaders in this yearâs municipal election, decreasing support for incumbent governors in their 2022 campaigns, said Thiago de AragÃ£o, director of strategy of the Arko Advice political consultancy. But as the death toll rose from less than 7,000 to more than 10,000 last week, local authorities began adopting stricter anti-virus measures. The riverside community of Tefe in the Amazon region was among the first, with a lockdown decree specifying criminal charges for residents leaving home except for visits to hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets. The mayor imposed it because only about half of Tefeâs 60,000 residents complied with an earlier recommendation by the governor of Amazonas state to take virus precautions. Those who did not comply âthink theyâre immortal, that they wonât get it,â Tefe Mayor Normando Bessa de SÃ¡ said on Facebook. Over the next three days, the governors of the northern and northeastern states of Maranhao, Para and Ceara decreed lockdowns for their capital cities as intensive-care units filled with COVID-19 patients. Despite the new lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo still donât have mandatory stay-at-home-orders at the state or city level â even though they are the hardest hit places in Brazil. Lockdowns âshould have been imposed at least three weeks ago, when the epidemic was already increasing, but not at this speed that it is now,â said Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory physician and researcher with the widely respected Oswaldo Cruz Foundation biological research group. âI gave that recommendation more than once,â said Dalcolmo, among the experts on a COVID-19 panel that advises Rioâs governor. Rio Gov. Wilson Witzel has decreed non-binding quarantine recommendations and commerce restrictions through the end of May. He pledged to make police available so the stateâs 92 mayors can enact lockdowns, instead of imposing them himself. In another example of Brazilâs scattershot local lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella on Monday prohibited non-residents from entering 11 neighborhoods and ordered the closure of all businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies in the teeming slums called favelas. âPeople still havenât perceived the need to avoid gatherings, stay home,â Crivella complained. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems. The cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo near Rio on Monday authorized fines and criminal charges for violating stay-at-home orders. Niteroi police took the temperatures of those entering the city, and put a man and his two dogs inside a police van after he allegedly refused to show documents to justify being out of his home. In Sao Paulo state, Gov. JoÃ£o Doria last month urged but did not require residents to self-quarantine while shutting down schools and most businesses. Nearly 70% of the stateâs 44 million people initially complied, but that dropped below 50% in recent weeks, according to cellphone carrier data provided by the state. Doria, a presidential hopeful, saw his popularity increase as he challenged Bolsonaro. But police stopped enforcing his recommendations after Bolsonaro criticized the handcuffing and detention of a middle-aged woman exercising in a park who resisted removal. With noncompliance rising, Doria said last week that âif we need to step up to a lockdown, we will not hesitate.â Sao Pauloâs mayor this week limited vehicles circulating in the city to 50% of the normal flow. Television images showed long lines of people entering crammed buses with standing room only in clear violation of social distancing guidelines. Public health analysts from the Imperial College London, whose COVID-19 research has guided global policymakers, last week called Brazilâs anti-virus efforts âpartially successful.â âIn the absence of the introduction of further control measures that will more strongly curb transmission, Brazil faces the prospect of an epidemic that will continue to grow exponentially,â they wrote. ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Brazil cities lurch to lockdowns amid virus crisis red flags.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch ( the government ) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature ( the parliament ) .\nTask 3 output: No"}, {"instruction": "Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, while still maintaining the context and relationship between the objects in the question.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416â359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359â299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

While Underwood is no fan of President Donald Trump, she said her No. 1 concern â and the top concern of the voters she hopes to will send her to Washington â is access to health care. Attacking the Republican president hard just isnât necessarily a winning play in Illinoisâ 14th congressional district, said Underwood, who served as an adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services under Democratic President Barack Obama. âI donât talk about him that much. He has a higher approval rating than my congressman does, so we talk about our congressman,â said Underwood, whoâs hoping to oust incumbent Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren in a district that narrowly backed Trump two years ago. Other Democrats aiming to flip House seats say theyâre also trying to zero in on policy more than the president. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has its hopes pinned on 50-plus candidates looking to upend enough seats â 23 â to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP for the first time in eight years. Republicans have their own plan to retain control, but Democrats are banking they have more than just both momentum and history on their side. U.S. Rep. Denny Heck is helping lead the effort to flip the House. The Washington Democrat said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee can assist candidates with a range of tasks â from tapping into a national donor base to aiding with the basic mechanics of building a campaign. But he warned that trash-talking Trump will get a candidate only so far. âWhat candidates ought to be doing is talking about that crowded freeway that they need to get additional funds to widen or additional funds to provide mass transit for, or that lake that is becoming polluted and they need the EPA to step up,â Heck said. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is also on the âRed to Blueâ list. Mucarsel-Powell, who came from Ecuador as an immigrant with her mother, said Floridaâs 26th Congressional District â the stateâs southernmost district â is one of the most vulnerable for Republicans in the country. She pointed to a 16-point win by Hillary Clinton there in 2016. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo. While Mucarsel-Powell doesnât shy away from talking about Trump, she says sheâs more focused on the struggles of local residents. âThey donât have access to health care. They donât have good quality education,â she said, adding that tens of thousands depend on the Obama 2010 health care law that Republicans have worked to undo. Talk of a Democratic blue wave is overblown, according to Matt Gorman, communication director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said the committee â which has its own âYoung Gunsâ program â is raising impressive sums and has battle-tested incumbents who know theyâre going to be targets. Gorman said the NRCC is also urging candidates to run on local issues and not focus on the latest headlines on cable new or Twitter. He said polling shows the party is in better shape than many assume. âThis is going to be a fight and certainly weâre going to work like weâre 10 points down as we do every day, but for the bedwetters out there who are claiming that all hope is loss I would encourage them to actually look at the data,â he said. âItâs simple math.â Democratic Rep. Katherine Clark, who is also heading up the DCCCâs âRed to Blueâ initiative, said many candidates sheâs been working with are more eager to dig into whatâs on the minds of voters than taking swipes at Trump. âTheyâre not concerned with talking about Donald Trump as much as they are about talking about how people in their communities want their children to have job opportunities in the communities that they grew up in,â Clark said. While defeating Trump may galvanize the Democratic faithful, the party is still fumbling for a wider unifying message, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor and former political media consultant. And Democrats may have trouble finding issues, local or not, for voters to latch onto in November. âThe problem is that unemployment is low, economic confidence is relatively high, so to tell people youâve never had it so bad when compared to eight years ago theyâve got it pretty good, thatâs sort of also a tough road to hoe,â he said. âThe Democrats may have history on the side. The question is A, will they blow it? And B, is Trump such an anomaly that history is being rewritten?â Roxane Pirayesh, a 32-year-old from Sacramento, California, who works for an education nonprofit, said in the end, the pitch from Democrats has to be more than just an anti-Trump drumbeat â and sheâs not sure everyoneâs gotten the message. âI think thatâs probably the biggest flaw coming out of the Democratic Party,â she said.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: the chicken be happy the chicken be sad the chicken be a handy dandy man the dodo be his friend the chicken be go the chicken will return another day only if he see his friend again the dodo be here in the museum so the chicken may come he will live at a farm he will meet a goat name bob and have a friend after all so the chicken return with a smile on his face and see the dodo and never leave again but this be a dream\nTask 3 output: MAKE_RESTAURANT_RESERVATIONS"}, {"instruction": "Fill in the blank with a word that completes the sentence. and then Generate a sentence describing a day-to-day scene using the completed word and the given set of concepts. and then Generate a poem related to the given sentence, written in a simple and childlike manner.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its OsÃ© robotic âpersonal massager.â Itâs one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad âbooth babes,â fostering a âboysâ clubâ reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official âequality partner,â The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. âItâs been a process,â said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. Itâs been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startupsâ female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Craveâs exhibit included a camper with a âBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,â where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other âfem techâ companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. âLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,â said Barrica, who recently published the book âSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.â Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasnât been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. âItâs entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,â she said. Founders insist that their devices â ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories â have effects outside the bedroom. âSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,â said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. âIt does way more than just pleasure. Itâs immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.â DiCarloâs $290 OsÃ© device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed âimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTAâs image.â DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new âInnovation for Allâ sessions with senior diversity officials. OsÃ© began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. âThings are better, but thereâs just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,â she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ APâs CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: looked forward to experiencing the restaurants closer to asu .\nTask 3 output: Flower nectar."}, {"instruction": "Generate a story based on the given prompt. and then Generate a sentence describing a day-to-day scene using the extracted RDF triplets. and then Count the number of nouns or verbs in the day-to-day scene sentence.", "input": "Background Paragraph: Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through.

Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. In summary, our studies suggest that GW3965 inhibits NDV infection, probably by affecting cholesterol homeostasis.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: The LXR ligand GW3965 inhibits Newcastle disease virus infection by affecting cholesterol homeostasis\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: By the early 1600s, brick and tile were being made on a small scale.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: twenty seven, five foot eleven, one hundred sixty five pounds, black wavy hair, end quote,\nTask 3 output: ['', 'this', 'video,', 'I', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'a', 'few', 'examples', 'dealing', 'with', 'functions', 'and', 'functions', 'tend', 'to', 'be', 'something', 'that', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'students', 'find', 'difficult,', 'but', 'I', 'think', 'if', 'you', 'really', 'kind', 'of', 'get', 'what', \"we're\", 'talking', 'about,', \"you'll\", 'see', 'that', \"it's\", \"it's\", 'actually', 'a', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'idea.', 'And', 'you', 'sometimes', 'wonder,', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'hubbub', 'about?', 'All', 'a', 'function', 'is,', 'is', 'an', 'association', 'between', 'two', 'variables.', 'So', 'if', 'we', 'say', 'that', 'y', 'is', 'equal', 'to', 'a', 'function', 'of', 'x,', 'all', 'that', 'means', 'is,', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'an', 'X', 'you', 'kind', 'of', 'you', 'can', 'imagine', 'this']"}, {"instruction": "Write a middle sentence that connects the beginning and ending of a story.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand MÄori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the name of the person who rarely worked with Heseltine, although they had much in common?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A nice is the particular way a species makes a living.\nTask 3 output: UPDATE_CONTACT"}, {"instruction": "Write the beginning of a short story based on the given middle and ending.

While public health experts are demanding bolder action, most governors and mayors have not imposed mandatory stay-at-home orders. Their apparent reluctance comes amid Bolsonaroâs relentless message for Brazilians to defy regional and local public health efforts to stop the virusâ spread. Stricter lockdowns are needed because Brazilian doctors are now being forced to choose who lives and dies and triage situations could generate social unrest if they increase, said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazilâs non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. âWe need to avoid a total disaster,â he said. Lago said mandatory lockdowns across much of the country would help: âIt is late in terms of avoiding hospital collapse, but certainly it isnât too late to avoid a bigger catastrophe.â Brazil had more than 177,000 confirmed cases on Tuesday, with the actual figure believed to be much higher because of limited testing. Many intensive care hospital units are full and cemeteries are increasingly overwhelmed with bodies. Bolsonaro, who called the virus a âlittle flu,â has insisted for more than a month that governors are stoking economic carnage with voluntary quarantine recommendations and urges Brazilians to go about their everyday. He reiterated criticism of governors Tuesday for ignoring his decree that gyms, barbershops and beauty salons should be treated as essential services. Amid Bolsonaroâs rejection of coronavirus danger, most of the countryâs 27 governors have criticized his stances but none have imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, the governors have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or deferred to mayors to make those decisions. Governors had been hoping the virus would not spread in Brazilâs warm climate, but their response is also a reflection of Brazilâs political landscape because the governors depend on mayors to endorse re-election campaigns. Many worry that imposing mandatory lockdowns could hurt local leaders in this yearâs municipal election, decreasing support for incumbent governors in their 2022 campaigns, said Thiago de AragÃ£o, director of strategy of the Arko Advice political consultancy. But as the death toll rose from less than 7,000 to more than 10,000 last week, local authorities began adopting stricter anti-virus measures. The riverside community of Tefe in the Amazon region was among the first, with a lockdown decree specifying criminal charges for residents leaving home except for visits to hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets. The mayor imposed it because only about half of Tefeâs 60,000 residents complied with an earlier recommendation by the governor of Amazonas state to take virus precautions. Those who did not comply âthink theyâre immortal, that they wonât get it,â Tefe Mayor Normando Bessa de SÃ¡ said on Facebook. Over the next three days, the governors of the northern and northeastern states of Maranhao, Para and Ceara decreed lockdowns for their capital cities as intensive-care units filled with COVID-19 patients. Despite the new lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo still donât have mandatory stay-at-home-orders at the state or city level â even though they are the hardest hit places in Brazil. Lockdowns âshould have been imposed at least three weeks ago, when the epidemic was already increasing, but not at this speed that it is now,â said Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory physician and researcher with the widely respected Oswaldo Cruz Foundation biological research group. âI gave that recommendation more than once,â said Dalcolmo, among the experts on a COVID-19 panel that advises Rioâs governor. Rio Gov. Wilson Witzel has decreed non-binding quarantine recommendations and commerce restrictions through the end of May. He pledged to make police available so the stateâs 92 mayors can enact lockdowns, instead of imposing them himself. In another example of Brazilâs scattershot local lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella on Monday prohibited non-residents from entering 11 neighborhoods and ordered the closure of all businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies in the teeming slums called favelas. âPeople still havenât perceived the need to avoid gatherings, stay home,â Crivella complained. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems. The cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo near Rio on Monday authorized fines and criminal charges for violating stay-at-home orders. Niteroi police took the temperatures of those entering the city, and put a man and his two dogs inside a police van after he allegedly refused to show documents to justify being out of his home. In Sao Paulo state, Gov. JoÃ£o Doria last month urged but did not require residents to self-quarantine while shutting down schools and most businesses. Nearly 70% of the stateâs 44 million people initially complied, but that dropped below 50% in recent weeks, according to cellphone carrier data provided by the state. Doria, a presidential hopeful, saw his popularity increase as he challenged Bolsonaro. But police stopped enforcing his recommendations after Bolsonaro criticized the handcuffing and detention of a middle-aged woman exercising in a park who resisted removal. With noncompliance rising, Doria said last week that âif we need to step up to a lockdown, we will not hesitate.â Sao Pauloâs mayor this week limited vehicles circulating in the city to 50% of the normal flow. Television images showed long lines of people entering crammed buses with standing room only in clear violation of social distancing guidelines. Public health analysts from the Imperial College London, whose COVID-19 research has guided global policymakers, last week called Brazilâs anti-virus efforts âpartially successful.â âIn the absence of the introduction of further control measures that will more strongly curb transmission, Brazil faces the prospect of an epidemic that will continue to grow exponentially,â they wrote. ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Brazil cities lurch to lockdowns amid virus crisis red flags.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: With so many distinct Aboriginal groups , languages , beliefs and practices , scholars can not attempt to characterise , under a single heading , the full range and diversity of all myths being variously and continuously told , developed , elaborated , performed , and experienced by group members across the entire continent .\nTask 3 output: 1"}, {"instruction": "Fix an SQL query based on feedback. and then Generate a story based on the given pair of contradictory sentences. and then Identify the main topic word in the story.", "input": "SQL: SELECT Count ( * ) , Brand FROM Medication GROUP BY Brand Feedback: It should corresponds to number of rows of each value of medication medication in prescribes table .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: SELECT count(*) ,  T1.name FROM medication AS T1 JOIN prescribes AS T2 ON T1.code = T2.medication GROUP BY T1.brand\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Assuming I am correct, I would like to invite you to become join LOGOS-the League of Greek Orthodox Stewards.\nTask 3 output: account Synonym score"}, {"instruction": "Convert numbers in a paragraph into their text equivalents, including prefixes, postfixes, and punctuation. and then Fix the SQL query based on feedback from the RDF triplets. and then Correct the grammar errors in the fixed SQL query.", "input": "Moreover, the reference in paragraph 3 to paying, quote, the house rent on the 2nd, end quote,", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Moreover, the reference in paragraph three to paying, quote, the house rent on the second, end quote,\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Because he was reluctant to repeat it.

Ninety-six fans died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Sheffield ground on 15 April 1989. Giving evidence on 2 October, the jury heard Mr Marshall explain he was match commander for a rugby league match between Wigan and St Helens on Boxing Day 1989, which he said was held at Hillsborough. Mr Marshall compared that match with the FA Cup semi-final, in which 801 police officer were on duty - 38% of the force's manpower at the time. \"It might interest you to know that on Boxing Day the same year Wigan and St Helens played at Hillsborough [and] 27,500 people came to that game,\" he said. \"Do you know, I policed that game, I policed it with 12 policemen.\" On 8 October, he was asked how he had policed that game with only 12 officers with \"no public order problems\".

The colour is rich and goes very well with almost any navy blue outfit. However, it fit me a bit snug to the front probably because my feet are a bit broader.

The other bridesmaids paid over $80.00 in a dept. store. I found my daughter 'bridesmaid' the exact same shoe for much less. The quality is the same. the brand is the same, the look is the same and it fits perfectly., Review_3: I love the look of these shoes and they will forever be special to me as I wore them at my wedding. Had a few cosmos right after our ceremony so did not notice any comfort issues throughout the night, but the next morning my feet felt like they had been pinched around the toe area., Review_4: These are VERY nice shoes and so pretty, but there is a rim inside the top of the shoes by my toes that rub them and could cause a blister or sore, so even though they are great to look at they are not that comfortable., Review_5: These shoes run 0.5 size small, I had to exchange and pay for return shipping. Order 0.5 size larger than you usually wear, and they won't hurt or give you blisters even around the toe. Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute., Review_6: I bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding. They matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable. I wore these shoes longer than I have worn any heels. The lower heel gave me just enough height, but not to much to make me unsteady. Looking forward to wearing them again and again!, Review_7: These shoes run appropriate to size (I'm a size 9), but I felt like they pinched my toes as I have a wider foot. The shorter heel is nice so you don't have to worry about tripping- but I sent them back as I didn't find them comfortable., Review_8: Great Fast Amazon shipping, and the show itself is a really nice bright yellow, perfect for that pop of color I was looking for.

I was heading to the movies with a friend who had been begging me to go see it for days, although now I can't even fully recall which it was. There wasn't a lot of time for me to think as I was still groggy, so I quickly went back inside to grab a cup of coffee before heading out. Turning on the machine and hearing it whirr to start up I decided that I would also flick on the television real fast just to see what was going on in the world. I honestly can't remember what I saw, as my mind is blurry from the entire thing but I do remember it being quite boring to the point of remarkability, but what did stick out was the traffic alert. We were going to be late to the movie if we didn't leave soon so I quickly grabbed whatever coffee had been finished and rushed out the door having a completely black cup of joe that I didn't even want anymore. My friend was waiting for me at her house when I picked her up and was a bit annoyed that I was late, but I didn't think much of it. Now this is the part that really, really stuck out to me. Right as she got into the car, her daughter quickly ran outside and called her back in. When she came back out she was bright red and told me that she couldn't go, that she had to stay home and didn't want to explain but I was adamant and so she did. Apparently the babysitter couldn't make it in time and so it was all a bust, but instead of letting her feel bad I drove home real quick and picked up a blu-ray of a movie that I figured she would enjoy and drove back to her house. At this point you can probably realize this isn't exactly just a friend, but someone who I had wanted to impress and so when I returned and showed her the blu-ray we watched it together and it was a pretty awesome experience. The entire time all I could think was about how lucky I was to be in this house with her and her family, who seemed to be pretty receptive of me. Anyways, once this was all over instead of leaving she offered for me to stay for dinner and this is the first time I would ever have a meal with her alone as her daughter took a nap right after eating a few minutes earlier. This is so memorable for me because it was the first experience that I had in a romantic setting with this woman who I am now currently dating and I'll never forget it."}, {"instruction": "Generate a fact related to the given fact, based on the given topic word.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Marina Oswald testified that it was between nine and ten p.m.\nTask 3 output: the chicken be happy the chicken be sad the chicken be a handy dandy man the dodo be his friend the chicken be go the chicken will return another day only if he see his friend again the dodo be here in the museum so the chicken may come he will live at a farm he will meet a goat name bob and have a friend after all so the chicken return with a smile on his face and see the dodo and never leave again but this be a dream"}, {"instruction": "Decompose a yes/no question into a series of sub-questions that can be answered using Wikipedia articles.

driving home we are going through an intersection and get blind-sided by a girl going the wrong way down a one way(a normally very busy three lane one way). at first tina got very angry. storms over to her car but then sees that she is just a confused girl who just moved to the city and she calms down and they begin to talk rationally. out of nowhere a homeless man comes over and starts defending this girl who hit us. says that it was tina's fault and he will back up this girl when the police arrive. before tina is able to say anything another homeless/crackhead couple comes over to defend tina. now the homeless people are arguing with each other and the two girls are staring in shock. the homeless man defending tina begins to take off his shirt as if he is going to fight this other man. tina steps in between them and says something along the lines of \"get the fuck outta here\". the couple walks away and she continues talking with this girl. during this whole scene i had ran

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firmâs at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. âHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do. We have a test ready to submit,â she said. âWe need to get our test approved, and theyâre not giving us an option of how to get it approved.â   BioSure has been producing an at-home HIV test since 2015, and Bard met Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March to discuss her COVID-19 test. At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. âThere will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,â she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. âIf our test fails the validation, then itâs not fit to go to market,â she said. âIâm happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.â Claim: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: British regulators will this week reveal approval criteria for firms offering new coronavirus antibody tests, touted by governments in Britain and elsewhere as critical to easing nationwide lockdowns without helping the virus to spread.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Debate on welfare reform is increasing while those who need jobs are struggling.

METHODS AND RESULTS In 30 obese subjects (age 42Â±11 years, body mass index 46Â±11 kg/m(2)) undergoing bariatric surgery, we intraoperatively collected visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and characterized depot-specific adipose phenotypes. We assessed vasomotor function of the adipose microvasculature using videomicroscopy of small arterioles (75-250 Î¼m) isolated from different fat compartments. Endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation was severely impaired in visceral arterioles, compared to the subcutaneous depot (P<0.001 by ANOVA). Nonendothelium dependent responses to papaverine and nitroprusside were similar. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N(Ï)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester reduced subcutaneous vasodilation but had no effect on severely blunted visceral arteriolar responses. Visceral fat exhibited greater expression of proinflammatory, oxidative stress-related, hypoxia-induced, and proangiogenic genes; increased activated macrophage populations; and had a higher capacity for cytokine production ex vivo.     CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide clinical evidence that the visceral microenvironment may be intrinsically toxic to arterial health providing a potential mechanism by which visceral adiposity burden is linked to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Our findings also support the evolving concept that both adipose tissue quality and quantity may play significant roles in shaping cardiovascular phenotypes in human obesity.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Arteriolar function in visceral adipose tissue is impaired in human obesity.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: ['to', 'change', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'sound', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'properties', 'of', 'the', 'medium', 'that', 'that', 'sound', 'wave', 'is', 'traveling', 'through', 'and', \"there's\", 'two', 'main', 'factors', 'about', 'a', 'medium', 'that', 'will', 'determine', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'the', 'sound', 'wave', 'through', 'that', 'medium.', 'One', 'is', 'the', 'stiffness', 'of', 'the', 'medium', 'or', 'how', 'rigid', 'it', 'is.', 'The', 'stiffer', 'the', 'medium', 'the', 'faster', 'the', 'sound', 'waves', 'will', 'travel', 'through', 'it.', 'This', 'is', 'because', 'in', 'a', 'stiff', 'material,', 'each', 'molecule', 'is', 'more', 'interconnected', 'to', 'the', 'other', 'molecules', 'around', 'it.', 'So', 'any', 'disturbance', 'gets', 'transmitted', 'faster', 'down', 'the', 'line.', 'The', 'other', 'factor', 'that', 'determines', 'the']\nTask 3 output: Screen these samples."}, {"instruction": "Follow a sequence of instructions and perform basic logic and conditionals. and then Simplify each instruction sentence to make it easier for non-native English speakers to understand. and then Write a compressed version of the simplified text in one sentence.", "input": "Repeat cat five times.

This sequestration mechanism is facilitated by proteins on the vacuole membrane.Chemical priming has been proposed to increase tolerance to abiotic stresses in crop plants. In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: In a greenhouse, a botanist has just finished planting two of the same kind of plant.

Mr Agius quit earlier this month due to the Libor fixing scandal, but then had to take on the running of the company following the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined ÃÂ£290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand MÄori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the name of the person who rarely worked with Heseltine, although they had much in common?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Also known as by the name of the backbone is the vertebral column.\nTask 3 output: à¨ªà©à¨°à¨§à¨¾à¨¨ à¨®à©°à¨¤à¨°à© à¨¨à© à¨à¨¿à¨¹à¨¾ à¨à¨¿ à¨¸à¨¾à¨¡à© à¨¸à©°à¨¤à¨¾à¨ à¨à¨¤à© à¨ªà©à¨à©°à¨¬à¨°à¨¾à¨ à¨¨à© à¨¸à¨¾à¨¨à©à©° à¨¸à¨¾à¨¡à© à¨à¨¤à©à¨¤ à¨¦à¨¾ à¨¬à¨¿à¨¹à¨¤à¨°à©à¨¨ à¨¸à¨®à¨¾à¨à¨£ à¨¦à© à¨¸à¨¿à©±à¨à¨¿à¨ à¨¦à¨¿à©±à¨¤à© à¨à¨¤à© à¨¨à¨¾à¨²-à¨¨à¨¾à¨² à¨à©±à¨à© à¨µà©±à¨² à¨¦à©à¨à¨¦à© à¨°à¨¹à¨¿à¨£ à¨¤à© à¨¸à¨®à©à¨ à¨¦à© à¨¨à¨¾à¨²-à¨¨à¨¾à¨² à¨¬à¨¦à¨²à¨£ à¨¦à© à¨¸à¨¿à©±à¨à¨¿à¨ à¨¦à¨¿à©±à¨¤à©à¥¤"}, {"instruction": "Elaborate the given sentence by providing more details, using specific language, and adding additional information without changing the overall meaning. and then Generate a story based on the elaborated sentence. and then Identify the word with a typo in the story.", "input": "The Zugangserschwerungsgesetz was a German law which aimed to make the access to child pornography over the internet more difficult .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: The Zugangserschwerungsgesetz ( Access Impediment Act , or ZugErschwG ) was a German law that aimed to make it difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with depictions of sexual activity by and against children ( child pornography ) .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions.

Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: William Greer, operator of the Presidential limousine, estimated the car's speed at the time of the first shot as twelve to fifteen miles per hour.\nTask 3 output: ['CASE_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'UNKNOWN_TYPE_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'CASE_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'CASE_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'CASE_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'PUNCUATION_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF', 'NO_DIFF']"}, {"instruction": "Paraphrase the given sentence while maintaining its original meaning. and then Generate a story based on the paraphrased sentence. and then Write a compressed version of the story in one sentence.", "input": "The first five weapons were delivered in the first half of 1916 , with a total of 57 barrels and 56 cars completed by the end of the war .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: The first five weapons were delivered in the first half of 1916 .

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia. PAP in the two simplex individuals resolved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating that OAS1 dysfunction is associated with impaired surfactant catabolism due to the defects in AMs.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Heterozygous Mutations in OAS1 Cause Infantile-Onset Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis with Hypogammaglobulinemia\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: the salads are great , really something special .\nTask 3 output: ham"}, {"instruction": "Generate a title for a research paper based on a given paragraph. and then Simplify each sentence in the generated title to make it easier for non-native English speakers to understand. and then Generate an implausible answer to a question about the duration of an event based on the given simplified sentence.", "input": "Background: Infectious disease surveillance is a process the product of which reflects both actual disease trends and public awareness of the disease. Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The Jubilee line of 1979 was to be the first of four parts of the project.

Initially, the absorption of toxic metal ions is limited by cell membrane exclusion. Ions that are absorbed into tissues are sequestered in cell vacuoles. This sequestration mechanism is facilitated by proteins on the vacuole membrane.Chemical priming has been proposed to increase tolerance to abiotic stresses in crop plants. In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: In a greenhouse, a botanist has just finished planting two of the same kind of plant.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory.

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firmâs at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. âHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do. We have a test ready to submit,â she said. âWe need to get our test approved, and theyâre not giving us an option of how to get it approved.â   BioSure has been producing an at-home HIV test since 2015, and Bard met Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March to discuss her COVID-19 test. At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. âThere will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,â she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. âIf our test fails the validation, then itâs not fit to go to market,â she said. âIâm happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.â Claim: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: British regulators will this week reveal approval criteria for firms offering new coronavirus antibody tests, touted by governments in Britain and elsewhere as critical to easing nationwide lockdowns without helping the virus to spread.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: \"to discuss the bench sponsorship...call Barry at (317) 274-3246.\"\nTask 3 output: animal birth young."}, {"instruction": "Extract RDF triplets from the given sentence. and then Write a compressed version of the extracted RDF triplets in one sentence. and then Detect the positions of two consecutive words that have been swapped in the compressed sentence.", "input": "\"forced entry\" had 14.59 million U.S. viewers.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: [['forced entry', 'U.S._VIEWERS_(MILLIONS)', '14.59']]\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: How big of a Ping-Pong ball is covered by one antibody?

METHODS AND RESULTS In 30 obese subjects (age 42Â±11 years, body mass index 46Â±11 kg/m(2)) undergoing bariatric surgery, we intraoperatively collected visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and characterized depot-specific adipose phenotypes. We assessed vasomotor function of the adipose microvasculature using videomicroscopy of small arterioles (75-250 Î¼m) isolated from different fat compartments. Endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation was severely impaired in visceral arterioles, compared to the subcutaneous depot (P<0.001 by ANOVA). Nonendothelium dependent responses to papaverine and nitroprusside were similar. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N(Ï)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester reduced subcutaneous vasodilation but had no effect on severely blunted visceral arteriolar responses. Visceral fat exhibited greater expression of proinflammatory, oxidative stress-related, hypoxia-induced, and proangiogenic genes; increased activated macrophage populations; and had a higher capacity for cytokine production ex vivo.     CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide clinical evidence that the visceral microenvironment may be intrinsically toxic to arterial health providing a potential mechanism by which visceral adiposity burden is linked to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Our findings also support the evolving concept that both adipose tissue quality and quantity may play significant roles in shaping cardiovascular phenotypes in human obesity.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Arteriolar function in visceral adipose tissue is impaired in human obesity.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: ['', 'this', 'video,', 'I', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'a', 'few', 'examples', 'dealing', 'with', 'functions', 'and', 'functions', 'tend', 'to', 'be', 'something', 'that', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'students', 'find', 'difficult,', 'but', 'I', 'think', 'if', 'you', 'really', 'kind', 'of', 'get', 'what', \"we're\", 'talking', 'about,', \"you'll\", 'see', 'that', \"it's\", \"it's\", 'actually', 'a', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'idea.', 'And', 'you', 'sometimes', 'wonder,', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'hubbub', 'about?', 'All', 'a', 'function', 'is,', 'is', 'an', 'association', 'between', 'two', 'variables.', 'So', 'if', 'we', 'say', 'that', 'y', 'is', 'equal', 'to', 'a', 'function', 'of', 'x,', 'all', 'that', 'means', 'is,', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'an', 'X', 'you', 'kind', 'of', 'you', 'can', 'imagine', 'this']\nTask 3 output: Stereotype"}, {"instruction": "Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, flipping the answer from PersonX to PersonY.

He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \"Conrack\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \"what death would sound like\".  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \"the river.\"  As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.  As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

Ninety-six fans died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Sheffield ground on 15 April 1989. Giving evidence on 2 October, the jury heard Mr Marshall explain he was match commander for a rugby league match between Wigan and St Helens on Boxing Day 1989, which he said was held at Hillsborough. Mr Marshall compared that match with the FA Cup semi-final, in which 801 police officer were on duty - 38% of the force's manpower at the time. \"It might interest you to know that on Boxing Day the same year Wigan and St Helens played at Hillsborough [and] 27,500 people came to that game,\" he said. \"Do you know, I policed that game, I policed it with 12 policemen.\" On 8 October, he was asked how he had policed that game with only 12 officers with \"no public order problems\". The former superintendent said: \"It is a family game, family people, no problem.\" He also remarked how \"it can't be said of rugby league that it is some upper middle-class dilettante sport\" and that \"just as with some football supporters\" those who go to watch rugby league \"like a beer as well\". The 1989 Boxing Day game between Wigan and St Helens actually took place in Greater Manchester - at Wigan's then home ground, Central Park. In a statement read to the court on Tuesday, Mr Marshall said: \"It has been brought to my attention that... I gave erroneous evidence in that: 1. I did not police the Wigan-St Helens game on 26 December 1989 and 2. That game was not played at Hillsborough. \"I offer my unreserved apology for misleading the court.

GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Targeting A20 Decreases Glioma Stem Cell Survival and Tumor Growth\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['The Rice Boat', 'food', 'Fast food'], ['The Rice Boat', 'customer rating', 'low'], ['The Rice Boat', 'area', 'city centre'], ['The Rice Boat', 'familyFriendly', 'no']]\nTask 3 output: Heseltine."}, {"instruction": "Generate a natural language interpretation of a given command involving logical operations on a table. and then Provide a justification for the coreference between a pronoun and a noun phrase in the natural language interpretation.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: ['to', 'change', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'sound', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'properties', 'of', 'the', 'medium', 'that', 'that', 'sound', 'wave', 'is', 'traveling', 'through', 'and', \"there's\", 'two', 'main', 'factors', 'about', 'a', 'medium', 'that', 'will', 'determine', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'the', 'sound', 'wave', 'through', 'that', 'medium.', 'One', 'is', 'the', 'stiffness', 'of', 'the', 'medium', 'or', 'how', 'rigid', 'it', 'is.', 'The', 'stiffer', 'the', 'medium', 'the', 'faster', 'the', 'sound', 'waves', 'will', 'travel', 'through', 'it.', 'This', 'is', 'because', 'in', 'a', 'stiff', 'material,', 'each', 'molecule', 'is', 'more', 'interconnected', 'to', 'the', 'other', 'molecules', 'around', 'it.', 'So', 'any', 'disturbance', 'gets', 'transmitted', 'faster', 'down', 'the', 'line.', 'The', 'other', 'factor', 'that', 'determines', 'the']\nTask 3 output: Today we laid my mother in law to rest.

The state has increased the number of needle exchanges from five in 2015 to 33, in an attempt to provide clean injection supplies and training, the paper reported.

Speaking as he presented his two latest signings, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind, Van Gaal explained why Welbeck, 23, was sold to Arsenal for Â£16m. \"He played three seasons for the first team, but he doesn't have the record of Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney. And that is the standard,\" Van Gaal said. \"That is why we let him go, because of Falcao, but also to allow the youngsters to fit in. That is the policy. That is why I am here.\" Welbeck joined Arsenal on transfer deadline day in a deal Gunners manager Arsene Wenger revealed almost did not happen. The Manchester-born forward, who scored both goals for England in Monday's 2-0 victory over Switzerland, netted 29 times in 142 United appearances. Welbeck's international team-mate Rooney, 28, has scored 217 goals for United in 445 matches, while Dutchman van Persie, 31, has hit 48 in 78 games. United spent close to Â£150m during a summer transfer spree, but also allowed a large number of players to leave. Van Gaal said promoting local young players was a cornerstone of his philosophy at Old Trafford. \"We let 14 players go, we have only brought six players in,\" he added. \"That means there are many positions vacant, they are vacant for the youth. \"I have already used a lot of youngsters in the season and pre-season, so I am always willing to give young players chances - but they have to take the chances. \"The possibility is there. All the youngsters have to know that.\" Much of the attention during Thursday's news conference focused on Falcao. The Colombia striker hinted he wanted to stay at United beyond his season-long loan from Monaco, with the Old Trafford club having an option to buy him for Â£44m (55m euros) in the summer. \"This is a new process, a new team,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I would like to be here and part of his project. Every player wants to play Champions League. \"This year it is not possible in Manchester, but we are confident to achieve the qualification for the next season.\" Van Gaal praised Falcao, adding he believed he could lift United to new heights. \"When you see his record, it is unbelievable,\" he said. \"Today in the training session, he got one ball and it was in the goal. \"When I say this I put too much pressure on him, I know it is very difficult to come from another club to Manchester United in a new process.\"", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal says striker Danny Welbeck was sold because he did not score enough goals.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: female\nTask 3 output: No."}, {"instruction": "Elaborate the given sentence by providing more details, using specific language, and adding additional information without changing the overall meaning. and then Generate a sentence describing a day-to-day scene using the significant word and the given set of concepts. and then Generate a poem related to the given sentence, written in a simple and childlike manner.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand MÄori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the name of the person who rarely worked with Heseltine, although they had much in common?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Bacteria can cause many health issues.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Sir Michael Rake, deputy chairman of Barclays, has ruled himself out of the running to become the bank's chairman.\nTask 3 output: à¨ªà©à¨°à¨§à¨¾à¨¨ à¨®à©°à¨¤à¨°à© à¨¨à© à¨à¨¿à¨¹à¨¾ à¨à¨¿ à¨¸à¨¾à¨¡à© à¨¸à©°à¨¤à¨¾à¨ à¨à¨¤à© à¨ªà©à¨à©°à¨¬à¨°à¨¾à¨ à¨¨à© à¨¸à¨¾à¨¨à©à©° à¨¸à¨¾à¨¡à© à¨à¨¤à©à¨¤ à¨¦à¨¾ à¨¬à¨¿à¨¹à¨¤à¨°à©à¨¨ à¨¸à¨®à¨¾à¨à¨£ à¨¦à© à¨¸à¨¿à©±à¨à¨¿à¨ à¨¦à¨¿à©±à¨¤à© à¨à¨¤à© à¨¨à¨¾à¨²-à¨¨à¨¾à¨² à¨à©±à¨à© à¨µà©±à¨² à¨¦à©à¨à¨¦à© à¨°à¨¹à¨¿à¨£ à¨¤à© à¨¸à¨®à©à¨ à¨¦à© à¨¨à¨¾à¨²-à¨¨à¨¾à¨² à¨¬à¨¦à¨²à¨£ à¨¦à© à¨¸à¨¿à©±à¨à¨¿à¨ à¨¦à¨¿à©±à¨¤à©à¥¤"}, {"instruction": "Generate a fact related to the given fact, based on the given topic word.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

While public health experts are demanding bolder action, most governors and mayors have not imposed mandatory stay-at-home orders. Their apparent reluctance comes amid Bolsonaroâs relentless message for Brazilians to defy regional and local public health efforts to stop the virusâ spread. Stricter lockdowns are needed because Brazilian doctors are now being forced to choose who lives and dies and triage situations could generate social unrest if they increase, said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazilâs non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. âWe need to avoid a total disaster,â he said. Lago said mandatory lockdowns across much of the country would help: âIt is late in terms of avoiding hospital collapse, but certainly it isnât too late to avoid a bigger catastrophe.â Brazil had more than 177,000 confirmed cases on Tuesday, with the actual figure believed to be much higher because of limited testing. Many intensive care hospital units are full and cemeteries are increasingly overwhelmed with bodies. Bolsonaro, who called the virus a âlittle flu,â has insisted for more than a month that governors are stoking economic carnage with voluntary quarantine recommendations and urges Brazilians to go about their everyday. He reiterated criticism of governors Tuesday for ignoring his decree that gyms, barbershops and beauty salons should be treated as essential services. Amid Bolsonaroâs rejection of coronavirus danger, most of the countryâs 27 governors have criticized his stances but none have imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, the governors have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or deferred to mayors to make those decisions. Governors had been hoping the virus would not spread in Brazilâs warm climate, but their response is also a reflection of Brazilâs political landscape because the governors depend on mayors to endorse re-election campaigns. Many worry that imposing mandatory lockdowns could hurt local leaders in this yearâs municipal election, decreasing support for incumbent governors in their 2022 campaigns, said Thiago de AragÃ£o, director of strategy of the Arko Advice political consultancy. But as the death toll rose from less than 7,000 to more than 10,000 last week, local authorities began adopting stricter anti-virus measures. The riverside community of Tefe in the Amazon region was among the first, with a lockdown decree specifying criminal charges for residents leaving home except for visits to hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets. The mayor imposed it because only about half of Tefeâs 60,000 residents complied with an earlier recommendation by the governor of Amazonas state to take virus precautions. Those who did not comply âthink theyâre immortal, that they wonât get it,â Tefe Mayor Normando Bessa de SÃ¡ said on Facebook. Over the next three days, the governors of the northern and northeastern states of Maranhao, Para and Ceara decreed lockdowns for their capital cities as intensive-care units filled with COVID-19 patients. Despite the new lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo still donât have mandatory stay-at-home-orders at the state or city level â even though they are the hardest hit places in Brazil. Lockdowns âshould have been imposed at least three weeks ago, when the epidemic was already increasing, but not at this speed that it is now,â said Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory physician and researcher with the widely respected Oswaldo Cruz Foundation biological research group. âI gave that recommendation more than once,â said Dalcolmo, among the experts on a COVID-19 panel that advises Rioâs governor. Rio Gov. Wilson Witzel has decreed non-binding quarantine recommendations and commerce restrictions through the end of May. He pledged to make police available so the stateâs 92 mayors can enact lockdowns, instead of imposing them himself. In another example of Brazilâs scattershot local lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella on Monday prohibited non-residents from entering 11 neighborhoods and ordered the closure of all businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies in the teeming slums called favelas. âPeople still havenât perceived the need to avoid gatherings, stay home,â Crivella complained. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems. The cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo near Rio on Monday authorized fines and criminal charges for violating stay-at-home orders. Niteroi police took the temperatures of those entering the city, and put a man and his two dogs inside a police van after he allegedly refused to show documents to justify being out of his home. In Sao Paulo state, Gov. JoÃ£o Doria last month urged but did not require residents to self-quarantine while shutting down schools and most businesses. Nearly 70% of the stateâs 44 million people initially complied, but that dropped below 50% in recent weeks, according to cellphone carrier data provided by the state. Doria, a presidential hopeful, saw his popularity increase as he challenged Bolsonaro. But police stopped enforcing his recommendations after Bolsonaro criticized the handcuffing and detention of a middle-aged woman exercising in a park who resisted removal. With noncompliance rising, Doria said last week that âif we need to step up to a lockdown, we will not hesitate.â Sao Pauloâs mayor this week limited vehicles circulating in the city to 50% of the normal flow. Television images showed long lines of people entering crammed buses with standing room only in clear violation of social distancing guidelines. Public health analysts from the Imperial College London, whose COVID-19 research has guided global policymakers, last week called Brazilâs anti-virus efforts âpartially successful.â âIn the absence of the introduction of further control measures that will more strongly curb transmission, Brazil faces the prospect of an epidemic that will continue to grow exponentially,â they wrote. ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Brazil cities lurch to lockdowns amid virus crisis red flags.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: VERB\nTask 3 output: ham"}, {"instruction": "Generate a poem related to the given title, written in a simple and childlike manner.

Analysis of these cDNAs has enabled us to determine the entire structure of the human Golli-MBP gene. The Golli-MBP gene, which encompasses the MBP transcription unit, is approximately 179 kb in length and consists of 10 exons, seven of which constitute the MBP gene. The human Golli-MBP gene contains two transcription start sites, each of which gives rise to a family of alternatively spliced transcripts. At least two Golli-MBP transcripts, containing the first three exons of the gene and one or more MBP exons, are produced from the first transcription start site. The second family of transcripts contains only MBP exons and produces the well-known MBPs. In humans, RNA blot analysis revealed that Golli-MBP transcripts were expressed in fetal thymus, spleen, and human B-cell and macrophage cell lines, as well as in fetal spinal cord. These findings clearly link the expression of exons encoding the autoimmunogen/encephalitogen MBP in the central nervous system to cells and tissues of the immune system through normal expression of the Golli-MBP gene. They also establish that this genetic locus, which includes the MBP gene, is conserved among species, providing further evidence that the MBP transcription unit is an integral part of the Golli transcription unit and suggest that this structural arrangement is important for the genetic function and/or regulation of these genes.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: The human myelin basic protein gene is included within a 179-kilobase transcription unit: expression in the immune and central nervous systems.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Europop ( also Euro pop ) is a style of pop music that originated in Europe during the late 1960s and developed to today 's form throughout the late 1970s .\nTask 3 output: SINGLE_CATAPHORA"}, {"instruction": "Fix an SQL query based on feedback. and then Generate a natural language interpretation of the fixed SQL query involving logical operations on a table. and then Determine if the natural language interpretation has proper punctuation.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firmâs at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. âHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do. We have a test ready to submit,â she said. âWe need to get our test approved, and theyâre not giving us an option of how to get it approved.â   BioSure has been producing an at-home HIV test since 2015, and Bard met Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March to discuss her COVID-19 test. At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. âThere will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,â she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. âIf our test fails the validation, then itâs not fit to go to market,â she said. âIâm happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.â Claim: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: British regulators will this week reveal approval criteria for firms offering new coronavirus antibody tests, touted by governments in Britain and elsewhere as critical to easing nationwide lockdowns without helping the virus to spread.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The debate of 2001 concentrated on the one new mechanism for a lethal attack on Bin Ladin-an armed version\nTask 3 output: Heseltine."}, {"instruction": "Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, while still maintaining the context and relationship between the objects in the question.

GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored.

Initially, the absorption of toxic metal ions is limited by cell membrane exclusion. Ions that are absorbed into tissues are sequestered in cell vacuoles. This sequestration mechanism is facilitated by proteins on the vacuole membrane.Chemical priming has been proposed to increase tolerance to abiotic stresses in crop plants. In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: In a greenhouse, a botanist has just finished planting two of the same kind of plant.

There was no discussion in the story about whether there are different costs associated with the procedure itself. The story explained that the through-the-wrist approach was associated with lower risk of bleeding and shorter hospitalizations but should have included a caveat explanation about the strength of research and that the results of the study reported on require follow-up investigation. The story mentioned risk of bleeding at the site of catheter insertion as a possible harm of treatment which was greater for those who had a the catheter inserted in the leg. To its credit, the story provided absolute risk information, i.e. pointing out the 60% reduction in bleeding was the difference between 2 and 1% of patients having this complication. The story did not mention whether there were any particular side effects or harms associated with catheter insertion at the wrist. The story explained that the study was an analysis of information contained within a national registry. But it should have explained that this is the weakest type of study from which to draw a clinical conclusion (such as this procedure is safer or as safe as the alternative). Thus the statement in the story âboth methods were equally effectiveâ should have been more tentative. The underlying weakness of the study, that it is not a controlled trial, may mean that the patients who had the wrist approach had something else about them that helped to reduce risk and that the researchers may not have been able to take into consideration. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included interview material from one clinician who was not associated with the study reported on. The quality of the piece would have been improved if it had included input from physicians who might have explained some of the reasons why not all interventional cardiologists use the wrist approach. The story did an adequate job of reporting about a recent study comparing two approaches to angioplasty. The story indicated that the angioplasty using access through the wrist as opposed to a leg, was used much less frequently.vThe story explained that extra training is required in order to use this procedure and many doctors are not trained in this technique. This would contribute to the procedureâs limited availability. The story did a good job of explaining that neither of the two approaches compared were new and that the point of the study was to determine how the two sites compare in terms of their use.

It provided information that a reader could use to have a conversation with a doctor about the decision. However â the story should have included some insight about the strength of the observation obtained from the current study. As it was not a controlled study â so it did not evaluate the two procedures in a controlled environment â any predictions are tentative and require further examination.

The company is facing some 11,700 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products. Leavittâs lawyer, Joseph Satterley, accused J&J in his opening statement of knowingly selling a dangerous product, according to an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. âThe evidence will show that J&J knew about the asbestos risk and they continued to sell the product, giving consumers no opportunity to protect themselves,â he said. A lawyer for co-defendant Imerys Talc America, a unit of French Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), told the jury the evidence would show there is no asbestos in its talc and that Leavittâs disease was not caused by its product. A lawyer for J&J will make his opening remarks on Tuesday. âOur talc is safe and does not contain asbestos. For decades, Johnson & Johnsonâs Baby Powder has repeatedly been tested and been found not to contain asbestos,â the company said in response to a request for comment on Monday. J&J and Imerys have argued in court that decades of studies have shown their products to be safe and asbestos-free. Leavittâs is the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing internal J&J documents showing talc in the companyâs raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. The report prompted a stock selloff on fears of J&Jâs liability. Shares on Monday closed at $127.01, 14 percent below their Dec. 13 value. While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffsâ lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Leavittâs case is being tried by the same team of lawyers, including Satterley, who in April 2018 won a $117 million award by a New Jersey jury for a man who blamed his mesothelioma on J&Jâs cosmetic talc. That verdict is under appeal. In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal. Leavitt was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. She was born in the Philippines and claims she was exposed to J&J cosmetic talc that originated from South Korea mines during the first two years of her life before her parents moved back to the United States in 1968, Satterley said on Monday. He said testing of Asian talc samples from the 1960s and 1970s by his own expert would show Korean-mined talc tested positive for asbestos fibers, as has talc from U.S. sources. J&J in court filings in the Leavitt case said that fibers found in the Korean talc or any of its other cosmetic talc could not be classified as asbestos and referred to them as non-asbestos forms that its experts say are harmless. Geologically, some asbestos can occur as ânon-asbestiformâ rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits. The company in its Monday statement did not specifically address the allegations surrounding the South Korean mine.

The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said preliminary data show that the ACOs produced $380 million in savings vis-a-vis traditional Medicare in 2012 by giving doctors and other healthcare providers the incentive to focus on improved outcomes for patients instead of fees from tests and services. Medicare, the $575 billion government healthcare system for 51 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, faces growing financial pressures as a result of Americaâs aging population. A mainstay, the trust fund that pays for hospitalization, is expected to be exhausted in 2026. Deficit hawks view Medicare as a future driver of the federal debt and have called for major systemic reforms. But the Obama administration has pursued gradual changes including the reform of care delivery systems. So-called fee-for-service medicine is widely viewed as a cause of rising healthcare costs, because it calls for paying healthcare providers for tests and services that are sometimes unnecessary. Obamacare seeks to tackle costs by exploring ACOs and other new healthcare business models intended to find savings that do not jeopardize care. A main goal is to generate savings large enough to be shared between Medicare and providers. But some experts are skeptical, saying significant cost reductions could be hard to maintain over time. But CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, runs two different ACO programs. In its largest, 54 of 114 ACO networks achieved lower than expected expenditures. But only 29 saw savings big enough to share with providers. All told, the program produced $128 million in net savings for Medicareâs trust funds. âOverall, the ACO programâs a net saver to the Medicare program,â CMS principal deputy administrator Jon Blum told reporters in a conference call. âItâs giving us great confidence that this is the right course for the Medicare program and we are confident that it will continue to show quality improvement and cost savings.â  Officials said the ACOs also achieved a wide range of quality goals. But CMS released no quality statistics. Thursdayâs government release drew some cautious optimism from the healthcare industry. âTodayâs report reflects important steps. More work is needed to modernize our antiquated Medicare payment system and base payment on evidence-based quality measures and proven patient outcomes,â said Dr. John Noseworthy, chief executive of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which is not part of the governmentâs program. âAs results of the team-based care models are analyzed, those most effective in driving down health care costs without compromising safety and quality should become part of the healthcare system,â he said.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its OsÃ© robotic âpersonal massager.â Itâs one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad âbooth babes,â fostering a âboysâ clubâ reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official âequality partner,â The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. âItâs been a process,â said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. Itâs been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startupsâ female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Craveâs exhibit included a camper with a âBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,â where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other âfem techâ companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. âLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,â said Barrica, who recently published the book âSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.â Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasnât been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. âItâs entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,â she said. Founders insist that their devices â ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories â have effects outside the bedroom. âSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,â said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. âIt does way more than just pleasure. Itâs immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.â DiCarloâs $290 OsÃ© device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed âimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTAâs image.â DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new âInnovation for Allâ sessions with senior diversity officials. OsÃ© began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. âThings are better, but thereâs just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,â she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ APâs CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 3 output: A person is scrubbing a zucchini"}, {"instruction": "Generate a short summary of a Reddit post that includes a humorous situation. and then Generate a title for a research paper based on the given summary of the Reddit post. and then Determine if the research paper title is appropriate or makes sense based on the given context.", "input": "Text: so this started on wednesday when i woke up and was deaf in my right ear. it's happened before and normally only happens once every few months. i've got some condition where my ears create way too much wax and it sometimes gets clogged, so i ignored it, regained hearing by 1pm, and got on with it. then that night before bed i started losing hearing again, thought nothing, went to bed. woke up deaf again, went to bed with low hearing ability.   here's where the fuck up begins. i had an exam this morning which was quite important, and i thought there was no way i could go deaf. i'd miss the introductions and other bits like how much time was left etc. so last night, i decide to take maters into my own hands. \"olive oil eases ear wax and should allow it to pour out\" i remember being told. q-tip, dipped in olive oil, penetrate. big ugly orange/black clump of wax comes out, but the hearing isn't much better, so i dig deeper. in the process i force the larger lump which i could feel further in, rendering myself deaf. i thought it would ease come this morning, but i was proven wrong by the gods who seem to enjoy fucking with me.   exam went well, except i got stuck in traffic, then missed the intros through self inflicted deafness, then didn't hear the \"you can start\" announcement so sat staring blankly at my paper for 5 minutes. i have work tonight (i work in a bar with a dj on) so i'll likely fuck up there, a concert tomorrow, and more exams next week. currently awaiting the doctors to ring back with an appointment to syringe my ears.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: there once was a man with a clogged ear, who had an exam which was near, he stuck something in, because he was dim, and now he cannot hear.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 3 output: No."}, {"instruction": "Generate a story based on the given prompt. and then Fill in the blank in the story with one of the two objects mentioned in the story. and then Identify the word with a typo in the story.", "input": "Background Paragraph: Human populations are on the rise.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its OsÃ© robotic âpersonal massager.â Itâs one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad âbooth babes,â fostering a âboysâ clubâ reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official âequality partner,â The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. âItâs been a process,â said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. Itâs been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startupsâ female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Craveâs exhibit included a camper with a âBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,â where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other âfem techâ companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. âLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,â said Barrica, who recently published the book âSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.â Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasnât been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. âItâs entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,â she said. Founders insist that their devices â ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories â have effects outside the bedroom. âSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,â said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. âIt does way more than just pleasure. Itâs immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.â DiCarloâs $290 OsÃ© device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed âimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTAâs image.â DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new âInnovation for Allâ sessions with senior diversity officials. OsÃ© began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. âThings are better, but thereâs just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,â she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ APâs CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Joe walks into his house to see that his son has replaced the light bulbs in both the kitchen and the bathroom.

In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death.

This report from Sport England means what the LTA is doing, or failing to do, is absolutely unacceptable \"You don't give bonuses for failure, surely, and a priority has to be placed on grassroots sport. \"The LTA is one of the wealthiest sporting organisations in the country and it's my honest and genuine opinion that they are useless.\" The LTA published details of Draper's salary for the first time last week. He received a basic wage of Â£394,000, a bonus of Â£201,000 and a pension contribution of Â£45,000. This was a Â£42,000 increase on his package of Â£598,000 in 2011. Prime Minister David Cameron earns Â£142,500 a year. The figures were released days before Sport England announced its decision to withhold three years' funding from the LTA for grassroots tennis. The number of people playing tennis once a week has fallen from 487,500 in 2008 to 445,100 in 2012, and Sport England decided to give the LTA just one year's funding of Â£7.1m. \"This report from Sport England means what the LTA is doing, or failing to do, is absolutely unacceptable,\" added Baroness Billingham, who is urging sports minister Hugh Robertson to demand a meeting with Draper so he can explain himself. \"The people who can hire and fire are the board of the LTA, but I see no sign whatsoever that they are moving to even chastise Roger Draper.\" Sport England chief executive Jennie Price said a further Â£10.3m could be available to the LTA if it proves it has credible plans for how to improve participation in the sport. \"We need to give them a year to step up their game and prove they can deliver it,\" she said. On Monday, LTA chief commercial officer Simon Long said: \"Â£17.4m is a substantial potential award for British tennis and we are working closely with Sport England to ensure that we develop the best tennis offers to increase participation, whilst continuing to deliver a leading talent programme.\" A spokesman for the LTA added that Draper's salary had been decided by the LTA's remuneration committee after careful consideration.

The company is facing some 11,700 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products. Leavittâs lawyer, Joseph Satterley, accused J&J in his opening statement of knowingly selling a dangerous product, according to an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. âThe evidence will show that J&J knew about the asbestos risk and they continued to sell the product, giving consumers no opportunity to protect themselves,â he said. A lawyer for co-defendant Imerys Talc America, a unit of French Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), told the jury the evidence would show there is no asbestos in its talc and that Leavittâs disease was not caused by its product. A lawyer for J&J will make his opening remarks on Tuesday. âOur talc is safe and does not contain asbestos. For decades, Johnson & Johnsonâs Baby Powder has repeatedly been tested and been found not to contain asbestos,â the company said in response to a request for comment on Monday. J&J and Imerys have argued in court that decades of studies have shown their products to be safe and asbestos-free. Leavittâs is the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing internal J&J documents showing talc in the companyâs raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. The report prompted a stock selloff on fears of J&Jâs liability. Shares on Monday closed at $127.01, 14 percent below their Dec. 13 value. While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffsâ lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Leavittâs case is being tried by the same team of lawyers, including Satterley, who in April 2018 won a $117 million award by a New Jersey jury for a man who blamed his mesothelioma on J&Jâs cosmetic talc. That verdict is under appeal. In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal. Leavitt was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. She was born in the Philippines and claims she was exposed to J&J cosmetic talc that originated from South Korea mines during the first two years of her life before her parents moved back to the United States in 1968, Satterley said on Monday. He said testing of Asian talc samples from the 1960s and 1970s by his own expert would show Korean-mined talc tested positive for asbestos fibers, as has talc from U.S. sources. J&J in court filings in the Leavitt case said that fibers found in the Korean talc or any of its other cosmetic talc could not be classified as asbestos and referred to them as non-asbestos forms that its experts say are harmless. Geologically, some asbestos can occur as ânon-asbestiformâ rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits. The company in its Monday statement did not specifically address the allegations surrounding the South Korean mine.

Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firmâs at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. âHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do.

At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators.

Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. âIf our test fails the validation, then itâs not fit to go to market,â she said. âIâm happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.â Claim: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: British regulators will this week reveal approval criteria for firms offering new coronavirus antibody tests, touted by governments in Britain and elsewhere as critical to easing nationwide lockdowns without helping the virus to spread.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The LXR ligand GW3965 inhibits Newcastle disease virus infection by affecting cholesterol homeostasis\nTask 3 output: It is on the Southern California coast , in San Diego County , and bordered by Oceanside to the south , Cleveland National Forest , San Clemente , and Orange County to the north , Riverside County to the northeast , and Fallbrook to the east ."}, {"instruction": "Provide a justification for the coreference between a pronoun and a noun phrase in a sentence.

This report from Sport England means what the LTA is doing, or failing to do, is absolutely unacceptable \"You don't give bonuses for failure, surely, and a priority has to be placed on grassroots sport. \"The LTA is one of the wealthiest sporting organisations in the country and it's my honest and genuine opinion that they are useless.\" The LTA published details of Draper's salary for the first time last week. He received a basic wage of Â£394,000, a bonus of Â£201,000 and a pension contribution of Â£45,000. This was a Â£42,000 increase on his package of Â£598,000 in 2011. Prime Minister David Cameron earns Â£142,500 a year. The figures were released days before Sport England announced its decision to withhold three years' funding from the LTA for grassroots tennis. The number of people playing tennis once a week has fallen from 487,500 in 2008 to 445,100 in 2012, and Sport England decided to give the LTA just one year's funding of Â£7.1m. \"This report from Sport England means what the LTA is doing, or failing to do, is absolutely unacceptable,\" added Baroness Billingham, who is urging sports minister Hugh Robertson to demand a meeting with Draper so he can explain himself. \"The people who can hire and fire are the board of the LTA, but I see no sign whatsoever that they are moving to even chastise Roger Draper.\" Sport England chief executive Jennie Price said a further Â£10.3m could be available to the LTA if it proves it has credible plans for how to improve participation in the sport. \"We need to give them a year to step up their game and prove they can deliver it,\" she said.

The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \"what death would sound like\".  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \"the river.\"  As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.  As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

There was no discussion in the story about whether there are different costs associated with the procedure itself. The story explained that the through-the-wrist approach was associated with lower risk of bleeding and shorter hospitalizations but should have included a caveat explanation about the strength of research and that the results of the study reported on require follow-up investigation. The story mentioned risk of bleeding at the site of catheter insertion as a possible harm of treatment which was greater for those who had a the catheter inserted in the leg. To its credit, the story provided absolute risk information, i.e. pointing out the 60% reduction in bleeding was the difference between 2 and 1% of patients having this complication. The story did not mention whether there were any particular side effects or harms associated with catheter insertion at the wrist. The story explained that the study was an analysis of information contained within a national registry. But it should have explained that this is the weakest type of study from which to draw a clinical conclusion (such as this procedure is safer or as safe as the alternative). Thus the statement in the story âboth methods were equally effectiveâ should have been more tentative. The underlying weakness of the study, that it is not a controlled trial, may mean that the patients who had the wrist approach had something else about them that helped to reduce risk and that the researchers may not have been able to take into consideration. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included interview material from one clinician who was not associated with the study reported on.

The story indicated that the angioplasty using access through the wrist as opposed to a leg, was used much less frequently.vThe story explained that extra training is required in order to use this procedure and many doctors are not trained in this technique.

I plan to reorder the shoe but in a size 6., Review_4: I always take a 7 or 7.5, in fact own a pair of flipflops from this brand in a 7, decided to order 7.5 and it fits more like a 8.5 or even a 9. Way too large. Am returning & hope to replace with a smaller size., Review_5: I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style. I can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events. The shoes run big. I normally wear a 7 1 / 2, but ended up with the 7 which fit just right., Review_6: I ordered these shoes in a half size smaller than my regular size due to reviews that I read, but they were still too small. They were pretty shoes, so was very disappointed. The company was very good about refunding my money very quickly., Review_7: I don't believe these shoes will fit anyone who wears a narrow. If I order my true size, they're too short and my toes hit the front of the shoe yet if I order the next size up they're too wide yet my toes still hit in the same place. Both pairs went back -- bummer!, Review_8: I am in and out of areas where the footing can be slippery. I wanted a cute but totally functional shoe and this is it. Incredibly lightweight! I bet I could run in these.

Least square methods make the best use of available data directly computing the TD solution and thus do not require tuning a typically highly sensitive learning rate parameter, but require quadratic computation and storage. Recent algorithmic developments have yielded several sub-quadratic methods that use an approximation to the least squares TD solution, but incur bias. In this paper, we propose a new family of accelerated gradient TD (ATD) methods that (1) provide similar data efficiency benefits to least-squares methods, at a fraction of the computation and storage (2) significantly reduce parameter sensitivity compared to linear TD methods, and (3) are asymptotically unbiased.

I recently got divorced and was ready for big changes in my life. As I lay in bed I wondered what I could do, I felt suffocated for years while married and for the first time in a long time I felt free. Free to do whatever I wanted, I am not getting any younger I thought to myself. I got out of bed and went through my drawer for old diaries, I thought I would relive one of my best memories. Maybe go to six flags or.. as I opened the diary the first page I saw was about some goals I had years ago. In that entry.. travel the world was #2. You see I always wanted to travel the world I but my ex husband put me off of it by telling me we had no money or savings for things like that. As I stood there looking at my old diary I decided that I wanted to make that my number one goal for right NOW! I went downstairs, made myself a cup of coffee and jumped into the shower. I was exited about the possibility of travelling, I could leave everything behind and start over again some place else. My thoughts went everywhere, I wondered which country I would visit first, if I should look for air bnb or stay at a hotel. How much money do I have and where can I get more money from. With my thoughts all over the place. I got out of the shower, got dressed and started my research. I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months. As if this was my fate, I took this as a sign that I too should do this. I called up a friend who is a realtor and asked her to list my three bedroom starter home. She was confused and wanted to go out for a drink but I had allot to do and explained to her that I need to sell my furniture and everything inside my house and if we could have coffee at my house anytime she is free. She came over within an hour and thought I was going crazy. She did help me and knew of a family that might be interested in purchasing my house. Over the next few days I spend my time between cleaning, selling and getting organized. The family who were interested in purchasing came to have a look at it while I was still getting organized. The family were in urgent need of a place to live as they were moving from a different state but nothing could have prepared me for selling my house within 3 weeks and with a cash sale."}, {"instruction": "Generate a poem related to the given title, written in a simple and childlike manner.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: By the early 1600s, brick and tile were being made on a small scale.

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firmâs at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. âHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do.

At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. âThere will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,â she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. âIf our test fails the validation, then itâs not fit to go to market,â she said. âIâm happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.â", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: paper\nTask 3 output: Ken is a scientist who studies atomic systems.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The chieftains of the eastern Iceland were the last to accept the Norwegian king.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand MÄori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the name of the person who rarely worked with Heseltine, although they had much in common?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Bacteria can cause many health issues.

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firmâs at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. âHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do. We have a test ready to submit,â she said. âWe need to get our test approved, and theyâre not giving us an option of how to get it approved.â   BioSure has been producing an at-home HIV test since 2015, and Bard met Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March to discuss her COVID-19 test. At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. âThere will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,â she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. âIf our test fails the validation, then itâs not fit to go to market,â she said. âIâm happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.â Claim: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: British regulators will this week reveal approval criteria for firms offering new coronavirus antibody tests, touted by governments in Britain and elsewhere as critical to easing nationwide lockdowns without helping the virus to spread.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: After Alexander's death, the territory was divided among his generals, whose ambitions and antagonism led exposed Anatolia to the might of Rome.\nTask 3 output: polarity"}, {"instruction": "Given two analogies in the form \"A : B.

There was no discussion in the story about whether there are different costs associated with the procedure itself. The story explained that the through-the-wrist approach was associated with lower risk of bleeding and shorter hospitalizations but should have included a caveat explanation about the strength of research and that the results of the study reported on require follow-up investigation. The story mentioned risk of bleeding at the site of catheter insertion as a possible harm of treatment which was greater for those who had a the catheter inserted in the leg. To its credit, the story provided absolute risk information, i.e. pointing out the 60% reduction in bleeding was the difference between 2 and 1% of patients having this complication. The story did not mention whether there were any particular side effects or harms associated with catheter insertion at the wrist. The story explained that the study was an analysis of information contained within a national registry. But it should have explained that this is the weakest type of study from which to draw a clinical conclusion (such as this procedure is safer or as safe as the alternative). Thus the statement in the story âboth methods were equally effectiveâ should have been more tentative. The underlying weakness of the study, that it is not a controlled trial, may mean that the patients who had the wrist approach had something else about them that helped to reduce risk and that the researchers may not have been able to take into consideration. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included interview material from one clinician who was not associated with the study reported on. The quality of the piece would have been improved if it had included input from physicians who might have explained some of the reasons why not all interventional cardiologists use the wrist approach. The story did an adequate job of reporting about a recent study comparing two approaches to angioplasty. The story indicated that the angioplasty using access through the wrist as opposed to a leg, was used much less frequently.vThe story explained that extra training is required in order to use this procedure and many doctors are not trained in this technique.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theoryâthat his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death.

He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of BÃ©la BartÃ³k.On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \"What Music Is\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from BartÃ³k, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered  to be  among his finest work.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the last name of the composer who indicated that the man who moved to Ireland to forestall conscription interest in the occult turned into studies in religious philosophies?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: \"to discuss the bench sponsorship...call Barry at (317) 274-3246.\"\nTask 3 output: account IsA pay"}, {"instruction": "Convert a negative review to a positive review with minimal changes. and then Generate a question given a passage that mentions people, places, or things based on the natural language interpretation. and then Simplify the question by using simpler words and sentence structures while maintaining the same meaning.", "input": "the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: the falafel 's were so amazing , and had such a rich flavor .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch ( the government ) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature ( the parliament ) .\nTask 3 output: create electricity."}, {"instruction": "Generate a question given a passage that mentions people, places, or things. and then Write a compressed version of the simplified text in one sentence. and then Correct the grammar errors in the compressed sentence.", "input": "Passage: The story follows a young teacher, Pat Conroy (played by Jon Voight), in 1969 assigned to isolated \"Yamacraw Island\" (Daufuskie Island) off the coast of South Carolina and populated mostly by poor black families.

Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \"what death would sound like\".  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \"the river.\"  As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: ['', 'this', 'video,', 'I', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'a', 'few', 'examples', 'dealing', 'with', 'functions', 'and', 'functions', 'tend', 'to', 'be', 'something', 'that', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'students', 'find', 'difficult,', 'but', 'I', 'think', 'if', 'you', 'really', 'kind', 'of', 'get', 'what', \"we're\", 'talking', 'about,', \"you'll\", 'see', 'that', \"it's\", \"it's\", 'actually', 'a', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'idea.', 'And', 'you', 'sometimes', 'wonder,', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'hubbub', 'about?', 'All', 'a', 'function', 'is,', 'is', 'an', 'association', 'between', 'two', 'variables.', 'So', 'if', 'we', 'say', 'that', 'y', 'is', 'equal', 'to', 'a', 'function', 'of', 'x,', 'all', 'that', 'means', 'is,', 'you', 'give', 'me', 'an', 'X', 'you', 'kind', 'of', 'you', 'can', 'imagine', 'this']\nTask 3 output: not"}, {"instruction": "Provide a justification for the coreference between a pronoun and a noun phrase in a sentence.

The quality is the same. the brand is the same, the look is the same and it fits perfectly., Review_3: I love the look of these shoes and they will forever be special to me as I wore them at my wedding. Had a few cosmos right after our ceremony so did not notice any comfort issues throughout the night, but the next morning my feet felt like they had been pinched around the toe area., Review_4: These are VERY nice shoes and so pretty, but there is a rim inside the top of the shoes by my toes that rub them and could cause a blister or sore, so even though they are great to look at they are not that comfortable., Review_5: These shoes run 0.5 size small, I had to exchange and pay for return shipping. Order 0.5 size larger than you usually wear, and they won't hurt or give you blisters even around the toe. Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute., Review_6: I bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding. They matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable. I wore these shoes longer than I have worn any heels. The lower heel gave me just enough height, but not to much to make me unsteady. Looking forward to wearing them again and again!, Review_7: These shoes run appropriate to size (I'm a size 9), but I felt like they pinched my toes as I have a wider foot. The shorter heel is nice so you don't have to worry about tripping- but I sent them back as I didn't find them comfortable., Review_8: Great Fast Amazon shipping, and the show itself is a really nice bright yellow, perfect for that pop of color I was looking for.

Mr Agius quit earlier this month due to the Libor fixing scandal, but then had to take on the running of the company following the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined ÃÂ£290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

The colour is rich and goes very well with almost any navy blue outfit. However, it fit me a bit snug to the front probably because my feet are a bit broader.

The quality is the same. the brand is the same, the look is the same and it fits perfectly., Review_3: I love the look of these shoes and they will forever be special to me as I wore them at my wedding. Had a few cosmos right after our ceremony so did not notice any comfort issues throughout the night, but the next morning my feet felt like they had been pinched around the toe area., Review_4: These are VERY nice shoes and so pretty, but there is a rim inside the top of the shoes by my toes that rub them and could cause a blister or sore, so even though they are great to look at they are not that comfortable., Review_5: These shoes run 0.5 size small, I had to exchange and pay for return shipping. Order 0.5 size larger than you usually wear, and they won't hurt or give you blisters even around the toe. Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute., Review_6: I bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding. They matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable. I wore these shoes longer than I have worn any heels. The lower heel gave me just enough height, but not to much to make me unsteady. Looking forward to wearing them again and again!, Review_7: These shoes run appropriate to size (I'm a size 9), but I felt like they pinched my toes as I have a wider foot. The shorter heel is nice so you don't have to worry about tripping- but I sent them back as I didn't find them comfortable., Review_8: Great Fast Amazon shipping, and the show itself is a really nice bright yellow, perfect for that pop of color I was looking for.

GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Targeting A20 Decreases Glioma Stem Cell Survival and Tumor Growth\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['The Olive Grove', 'eatType', 'pub'], ['The Olive Grove', 'priceRange', 'Â£20-25'], ['The Olive Grove', 'area', 'riverside'], ['The Olive Grove', 'familyFriendly', 'yes']]\nTask 3 output: create electricity."}, {"instruction": "Complete the analogy by providing the appropriate consequence of the given action. and then Generate a poem related to the given title, written in a simple and childlike manner.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: 2003 â 2005 In 2003, he played a bad guy in the third movie of the Spy Kids trilogy.

Recent algorithmic developments have yielded several sub-quadratic methods that use an approximation to the least squares TD solution, but incur bias. In this paper, we propose a new family of accelerated gradient TD (ATD) methods that (1) provide similar data efficiency benefits to least-squares methods, at a fraction of the computation and storage (2) significantly reduce parameter sensitivity compared to linear TD methods, and (3) are asymptotically unbiased.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its OsÃ© robotic âpersonal massager.â Itâs one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad âbooth babes,â fostering a âboysâ clubâ reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official âequality partner,â The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. âItâs been a process,â said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. Itâs been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startupsâ female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Craveâs exhibit included a camper with a âBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,â where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other âfem techâ companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. âLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,â said Barrica, who recently published the book âSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.â Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasnât been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. âItâs entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,â she said. Founders insist that their devices â ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories â have effects outside the bedroom. âSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,â said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. âIt does way more than just pleasure. Itâs immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.â DiCarloâs $290 OsÃ© device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed âimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTAâs image.â DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new âInnovation for Allâ sessions with senior diversity officials. OsÃ© began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. âThings are better, but thereâs just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,â she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ APâs CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Joe walks into his house to see that his son has replaced the light bulbs in both the kitchen and the bathroom.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

Cicotte was motivated because Comiskey refused him a promised $10,000 should he win 30 games for the season.

Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. In summary, our studies suggest that GW3965 inhibits NDV infection, probably by affecting cholesterol homeostasis.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: The LXR ligand GW3965 inhibits Newcastle disease virus infection by affecting cholesterol homeostasis\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Ken is a scientist who studies atomic systems.

There was no discussion in the story about whether there are different costs associated with the procedure itself. The story explained that the through-the-wrist approach was associated with lower risk of bleeding and shorter hospitalizations but should have included a caveat explanation about the strength of research and that the results of the study reported on require follow-up investigation. The story mentioned risk of bleeding at the site of catheter insertion as a possible harm of treatment which was greater for those who had a the catheter inserted in the leg. To its credit, the story provided absolute risk information, i.e. pointing out the 60% reduction in bleeding was the difference between 2 and 1% of patients having this complication. The story did not mention whether there were any particular side effects or harms associated with catheter insertion at the wrist. The story explained that the study was an analysis of information contained within a national registry. But it should have explained that this is the weakest type of study from which to draw a clinical conclusion (such as this procedure is safer or as safe as the alternative). Thus the statement in the story âboth methods were equally effectiveâ should have been more tentative. The underlying weakness of the study, that it is not a controlled trial, may mean that the patients who had the wrist approach had something else about them that helped to reduce risk and that the researchers may not have been able to take into consideration. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included interview material from one clinician who was not associated with the study reported on. The quality of the piece would have been improved if it had included input from physicians who might have explained some of the reasons why not all interventional cardiologists use the wrist approach. The story did an adequate job of reporting about a recent study comparing two approaches to angioplasty. The story indicated that the angioplasty using access through the wrist as opposed to a leg, was used much less frequently.vThe story explained that extra training is required in order to use this procedure and many doctors are not trained in this technique. This would contribute to the procedureâs limited availability. The story did a good job of explaining that neither of the two approaches compared were new and that the point of the study was to determine how the two sites compare in terms of their use. The story does not appear to rely exclusively on a press release. Claim: Angioplasty through the wrist backed by new study", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: This is a good piece of reporting about a recent study comparing two different insertion sites to obtain access for angioplasty. While not providing any insight about the specific circumstances when there may be medical reasons to chose one access site over another, the story did a nice job of informing readers that there might actually be a choice when having an angioplasty. It provided information that a reader could use to have a conversation with a doctor about the decision. However â the story should have included some insight about the strength of the observation obtained from the current study. As it was not a controlled study â so it did not evaluate the two procedures in a controlled environment â any predictions are tentative and require further examination. Overall, though, this was a balanced, clear and concise story about an approach that might be a safer alternative to the dominant way of doing an angioplasty. The story included an independent expert to comment on theÂ study. And it reported absolute rates as well as relative rates so the reader can really get a sense of the safety ofÂ the new procedure.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['The Golden Palace', 'eatType', 'coffee shop'], ['The Golden Palace', 'food', 'French'], ['The Golden Palace', 'priceRange', 'more than Â£30'], ['The Golden Palace', 'customer rating', 'low'], ['The Golden Palace', 'area', 'city centre']]\nTask 3 output: Joe walks into his house to see that his son has replaced the light bulbs in both the kitchen and the bathroom.

He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \"Conrack\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \"what death would sound like\".  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \"the river.\"  As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.  As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. This film was shot in and around Brunswick, Georgia and used pupils from C.B.

On Monday, Sport England cut the LTA's funding, criticising its plans for increasing participation. \"It's unthinkable that someone earning four times more than the Prime Minister has not got ideas for the shake-up of the sport,\" Baroness Billingham said. This report from Sport England means what the LTA is doing, or failing to do, is absolutely unacceptable \"You don't give bonuses for failure, surely, and a priority has to be placed on grassroots sport. \"The LTA is one of the wealthiest sporting organisations in the country and it's my honest and genuine opinion that they are useless.\" The LTA published details of Draper's salary for the first time last week. He received a basic wage of Â£394,000, a bonus of Â£201,000 and a pension contribution of Â£45,000. This was a Â£42,000 increase on his package of Â£598,000 in 2011. Prime Minister David Cameron earns Â£142,500 a year. The figures were released days before Sport England announced its decision to withhold three years' funding from the LTA for grassroots tennis. The number of people playing tennis once a week has fallen from 487,500 in 2008 to 445,100 in 2012, and Sport England decided to give the LTA just one year's funding of Â£7.1m. \"This report from Sport England means what the LTA is doing, or failing to do, is absolutely unacceptable,\" added Baroness Billingham, who is urging sports minister Hugh Robertson to demand a meeting with Draper so he can explain himself. \"The people who can hire and fire are the board of the LTA, but I see no sign whatsoever that they are moving to even chastise Roger Draper.\" Sport England chief executive Jennie Price said a further Â£10.3m could be available to the LTA if it proves it has credible plans for how to improve participation in the sport. \"We need to give them a year to step up their game and prove they can deliver it,\" she said. On Monday, LTA chief commercial officer Simon Long said: \"Â£17.4m is a substantial potential award for British tennis and we are working closely with Sport England to ensure that we develop the best tennis offers to increase participation, whilst continuing to deliver a leading talent programme.\" A spokesman for the LTA added that Draper's salary had been decided by the LTA's remuneration committee after careful consideration.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the full name of the person that had their remains found four days after they had died?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Step1: When was Jimmy Wales born?, Step2: When was the iPhone created?, Step3: Is $x1 significantly before $x2?, not_definitive_answer: False, incorrect_answer: False\nTask 3 output: à¨®à©à¨¦à¨°à¨¾ à¨¯à©à¨à¨¨à¨¾ à¨¤à¨¹à¨¿à¨¤ 7,23,000 à¨à¨°à©à© à¨°à©à¨ªà¨ à¨¦à© 15."}, {"instruction": "Write a compressed version of the given text in one sentence. and then Generate a fact related to the given fact, based on the given topic word.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theoryâthat his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death. Sewell was unaware of his father's identity until 1986.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Because Paul was the person trying to perform an action.\nTask 3 output: remedy"}, {"instruction": "Generate a headline for a given text and then Correct the grammar errors in the fixed SQL query. and then Determine if the fixed SQL query has proper punctuation.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia. PAP in the two simplex individuals resolved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating that OAS1 dysfunction is associated with impaired surfactant catabolism due to the defects in AMs.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Heterozygous Mutations in OAS1 Cause Infantile-Onset Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis with Hypogammaglobulinemia\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: we loved the cream pancakes too .\nTask 3 output: SHOPPING"}, {"instruction": "Follow a sequence of instructions and perform basic logic and conditionals. and then Generate a story based on the given negative review. and then Translate the given negative review to Panjabi without omitting or adding any information.", "input": "Repeat all the world seven times, and after every second time add is a stage.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: all the world all the world is a stage all the world all the world is a stage all the world all the world is a stage all the world\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: the beans were in the burro and the rice was plentiful\nTask 3 output: [['Bobby Jackson', 'POSITION', 'G']]"}, {"instruction": "Correct the grammar errors in the given sentence. and then Write a compressed version of the explanation in one sentence. and then Classify the type of irony in the given compressed explanation as either 'polarity', 'situational', or 'other'.", "input": "['now', 'that', 'we', 'understand', 'ortho-para', 'directors', \"let's\", 'take', 'a', 'look', 'at', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'a', 'meta', 'director', 'and', 'so', 'we', 'start', 'with', 'nitrobenzene', 'and', 'if', 'our', 'goal', 'is', 'to', 'nitrate', 'nitrobenzene', 'alright', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'add', 'something', 'like', 'fuming', 'nitric', 'acid', 'sulfuric', 'acid', 'as', 'our', 'catalyst', 'and', 'we', 'also', 'need', 'to', 'heat', 'it', 'up', 'so', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'force', 'this', 'reaction', 'to', 'occur', 'because', 'nitro', 'benzene', 'turns', 'out', 'to', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'reactive', 'as', 'benzene', 'itself', 'and', 'so', 'the', 'end', 'result', 'is', 'to', 'add', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the', 'meta', 'position', 'right', 'so', 'we', 'added', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the']", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: ['Now', 'that', 'we', 'understand', 'ortho/para', 'directors,', \"let's\", 'take', 'a', 'look', 'at', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'a', 'meta', 'director.', 'And', 'so', 'we', 'start', 'with', 'nitrobenzene.', 'And', 'if', 'our', 'goal', 'is', 'to', 'nitrate', 'nitrobenzene', 'alright', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'add', 'something', 'like', 'fuming', 'nitric', 'acid,', 'sulfuric', 'acid', 'as', 'our', 'catalyst,', 'and', 'we', 'also', 'need', 'to', 'heat', 'it', 'up.', 'So', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'force', 'this', 'reaction', 'to', 'occur', 'because', 'nitro', 'benzene', 'turns', 'out', 'to', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'reactive', 'as', 'benzene', 'itself.', 'And', 'so', 'the', 'end', 'result', 'is', 'to', 'add', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'into', 'the', 'meta', 'position', 'right', 'so', 'we', 'added', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the']\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: glac.\nTask 3 output: True"}, {"instruction": "Paraphrase the given sentence while maintaining its original meaning. and then Generate a sentence describing a day-to-day scene using the given concepts. and then Generate a humorous title for a Reddit post based on the day-to-day scene.", "input": "Werder 's forces invested Belfort and reached the city on 3 November .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Werder 's troops invested Belfort and reached the city on November 3 .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer?\nTask 3 output: It's a real blast.

Mr Agius quit earlier this month due to the Libor fixing scandal, but then had to take on the running of the company following the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined ÃÂ£290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of Â£4.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Griffiths afterwards admitted that he had been employed in defrauding the bank since eighteen forty six,\nTask 3 output: [['15', 'TIMESLOT', 'tuesday 9/8c']]"}, {"instruction": "Generate a question based on a list of triplets, replacing the subject and/or object with blanks. and then Generate a topic word that is related to the given question and includes at least one word from the question. and then Determine if the topic word is plausible or matches common sense.", "input": "[['Shelby Fletcher', 'YEARS', '1'], ['[TABLECONTEXT]', 'COACH', 'Shelby Fletcher'], ['Shelby Fletcher', 'RECORD', '1-0'], ['[TABLECONTEXT]', '[TITLE]', 'Alabama Crimson Tide baseball']]", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: _____  served as coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide baseball team for 1 year, with a 1-0 record.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: animal birth young.\nTask 3 output: True"}, {"instruction": "Generate a story based on the given prompt. and then Generate a sentence describing a day-to-day scene using the concepts from the generated story. and then Summarize the generated story in one sentence.", "input": "Background Paragraph: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416â359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359â299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its OsÃ© robotic âpersonal massager.â Itâs one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad âbooth babes,â fostering a âboysâ clubâ reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official âequality partner,â The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. âItâs been a process,â said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. Itâs been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startupsâ female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Craveâs exhibit included a camper with a âBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,â where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other âfem techâ companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. âLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,â said Barrica, who recently published the book âSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.â Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasnât been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. âItâs entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,â she said. Founders insist that their devices â ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories â have effects outside the bedroom. âSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,â said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. âIt does way more than just pleasure. Itâs immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.â DiCarloâs $290 OsÃ© device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed âimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTAâs image.â DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new âInnovation for Allâ sessions with senior diversity officials. OsÃ© began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. âThings are better, but thereâs just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,â she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ APâs CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The US has remembered the victims of the 9/11 attacks in a series of memorials marking the 12th anniversary.\nTask 3 output: True"}, {"instruction": "Convert a positive review to a negative review while keeping the context intact. and then Extract RDF triplets from the negative review. and then Select the correct answer option for the extracted RDF triplets.", "input": "the best mexican food in the phoenix area .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: the worst mexican food in the phoenix area .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University', 'CITY', 'Aarhus'], ['School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University', 'COUNTRY', 'Denmark'], ['Aarhus', 'HAS_TO_ITS_NORTHEAST', 'Mols'], ['Denmark', 'LEADER_NAME', 'Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen']]\nTask 3 output: C"}, {"instruction": "Simplify each sentence to make it easier for non-native English speakers to understand. and then Predict the appropriate last sentence of the story. and then Determine if the predicted last sentence completes the story coherently or not.", "input": "2002: shuttle bus service is replaced by the suspended monorail called the SkyTrain connects the terminal building with the InterCity train station.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: 2002: shuttle bus service is replaced by the suspended monorail called the SkyTrain.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University', 'CITY', 'Aarhus'], ['School of Business and Social Sciences at the Aarhus University', 'COUNTRY', 'Denmark'], ['Aarhus', 'HAS_TO_ITS_NORTHEAST', 'Mols'], ['Denmark', 'LEADER_NAME', 'Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen']]\nTask 3 output: yes"}, {"instruction": "Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, while still maintaining the context and relationship between the objects in the question.

Cicotte was motivated because Comiskey refused him a promised $10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) with the excuse that the 35-year-old veteran's arm needed a rest before the series.

Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

The British government has provisionally ordered 17.5 million of them, but health minister Matt Hancock has said some of those already being trialled work poorly, and that one test even missed three out of four cases. Brigette Bard, chief executive of the diagnostics firm BioSure, said that her firmâs at-home test could not get as far as a formal trial as she had received no details of the approval criteria. âHow they fail tests when there is no specification, I literally have no idea. We have been begging to be told what to do.

At-home tests, in this case of blood obtained by pricking a finger, are designed to be read by the person taking the test, whereas others need results to be read in a lab. Bard said laboratory trials were producing good data, but that the firm needed to know what size and scope of trial and what accuracy level would be accepted by regulators. Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said that clarity would be coming soon. âThere will be specifications released for tests this week by MHRA (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) which will help companies understand the technical performance expected for their kits,â she said in an email. The MHRA itself said it was developing the specifications but declined to give a timeline. Once criteria were established, Bard said the trials would take one or two weeks, and then BioSure could begin production, subject to approval, with the aim of making 1 million tests a month. âIf our test fails the validation, then itâs not fit to go to market,â she said. âIâm happy to go through whatever validation they want us to go through.â", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Britain to reveal trial criteria for coronavirus antibody tests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: pigs\nTask 3 output: ''what if by heather munsey what if kid rule the world then the world would be sort of unorganized what if animal could talk then we would be able to understand them what if kid tell their parent what to do then they would never be in trouble what if you could pause time then life would be pretty neat what if you could choose your grade on your report card then all kid would probably have all aa's on our report card what if you could pick money off tree everyday then we would all be rich what if you could eat anything and not get fat then we all would be skinny what if you could drive at any age then kid would be get speeding ticket all the time what if you could meet famous star whenever you want then we would all be in heaven what if your room would clean itself then parent would never think a tornado live in your room what if your homework would get do by itself then kid would be in heaven what if you could cheat on a test without get catch then you could pass all your test all the time what if kid teach the teacher then teacher will be the one get yell at what if you have a genie and you have 1 000 wish a day then the whole world would be in heaven what if you do not have to do chore then i love my life"}, {"instruction": "Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, while still maintaining the context and relationship between the objects in the question.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [['The Waterman', 'eatType', 'restaurant'], ['The Waterman', 'food', 'Chinese'], ['The Waterman', 'priceRange', 'high'], ['The Waterman', 'customer rating', '1 out of 5'], ['The Waterman', 'area', 'riverside'], ['The Waterman', 'familyFriendly', 'no']]\nTask 3 output: Stereotype"}, {"instruction": "Generate a title for a research paper based on a given paragraph. and then Correct the grammar errors in the given research paper title. and then Determine if the corrected research paper title is plausible or matches common sense.", "input": "RNase L is an ankyrin repeat domain-containing dual endoribonuclease-pseudokinase that is activated by unusual 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate (2-5A) second messengers and which impedes viral infections in higher vertebrates.

The involvement of the pseudokinase domain of RNase L in 2-5A sensing, nucleotide binding, dimerization, and ribonuclease functions highlights the evolutionary adaptability of the eukaryotic protein kinase fold.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Article Dimeric Structure of Pseudokinase RNase L Bound to 2-5A Reveals a Basis for Interferon-Induced Antiviral Activity\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: [\"We're\", 'asked', 'to', 'reflect', 'this', 'line', 'across', 'the', 'line', 'y', 'is', 'equal', 'to', 'negative', '4.', 'So', 'you', 'have', 'this', 'line', 'right', 'over', 'here,', 'and', 'they', 'actually', 'give', 'us', 'all', 'of', 'these', 'transformation', 'tools', 'right', 'over', 'here', 'where', 'we', 'can', 'Translate,', 'Rotate,', 'Reflect,', 'Dilate,', 'or', 'Undo', 'what', 'we', 'were', 'about', 'to', 'do.', 'So', 'they', 'want', 'us', 'to', 'reflect', 'this', 'line', 'across', 'y', 'is', 'equal', 'to', 'negative', '4.', 'So', \"let's\", 'get', 'the', 'Reflection', 'tool', 'out', 'the', 'reflection', 'tool', 'so', 'I', 'clicked', 'reflect', 'and', \"let's\", \"let's\", 'make', 'this', 'equal', \"let's\", 'make', 'this', 'or', \"let's\", 'make', 'this', 'line', 'be', 'y', 'equals', 'negative', '4.', 'So']\nTask 3 output: Joe walks into his house to see that his son has replaced the light bulbs in both the kitchen and the bathroom.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2.

Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia.

He says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears.

This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week.

He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\".

He received a basic wage of Â£394,000, a bonus of Â£201,000 and a pension contribution of Â£45,000. This was a Â£42,000 increase on his package of Â£598,000 in 2011. Prime Minister David Cameron earns Â£142,500 a year. The figures were released days before Sport England announced its decision to withhold three years' funding from the LTA for grassroots tennis. The number of people playing tennis once a week has fallen from 487,500 in 2008 to 445,100 in 2012, and Sport England decided to give the LTA just one year's funding of Â£7.1m. \"This report from Sport England means what the LTA is doing, or failing to do, is absolutely unacceptable,\" added Baroness Billingham, who is urging sports minister Hugh Robertson to demand a meeting with Draper so he can explain himself. \"The people who can hire and fire are the board of the LTA, but I see no sign whatsoever that they are moving to even chastise Roger Draper.\" Sport England chief executive Jennie Price said a further Â£10.3m could be available to the LTA if it proves it has credible plans for how to improve participation in the sport. \"We need to give them a year to step up their game and prove they can deliver it,\" she said.

On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theoryâthat his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one.

He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of BÃ©la BartÃ³k.On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \"What Music Is\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from BartÃ³k, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered  to be  among his finest work.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the last name of the composer who indicated that the man who moved to Ireland to forestall conscription interest in the occult turned into studies in religious philosophies?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Debate on welfare reform is increasing while those who need jobs are struggling.

He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of BÃ©la BartÃ³k.On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \"What Music Is\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from BartÃ³k, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions.
