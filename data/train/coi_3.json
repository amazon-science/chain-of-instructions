The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation.

When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like the streetlight pictured in the Figure below , produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. In addition to lighting city streets, vapor lights are used to light highways and stadiums. The bulbs are very bright and long lasting so they are a good choice for these places.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Joe walks into his house to see that his son has replaced the light bulbs in both the kitchen and the bathroom.

The room is bathed in a cool, calming light, giving it a modern and futuristic feel. Joe's curiosity piqued, he decides to venture further into the house, towards the bathroom. As he opens the door, he is greeted by a warm, golden glow that envelops the room. The light bulbs in the bathroom emit a soft, yellow tint, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Joe realizes that his son has carefully chosen these light bulbs to create different moods in each room.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416\u2013359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America.

Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Subject: Influenza surveillance systems performance, Predicate: Characterizing, Object: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 3 output: Unrelated"}, {"instruction": "Generate a title for a research paper based on a given paragraph. and then Correct the grammar errors in the given research paper title. and then Determine if the corrected research paper title is plausible or matches common sense.", "input": "RNase L is an ankyrin repeat domain-containing dual endoribonuclease-pseudokinase that is activated by unusual 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate (2-5A) second messengers and which impedes viral infections in higher vertebrates.

He says they signal a \u00a33.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and \u00a31bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around \u00a311bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\".

He received a basic wage of \u00a3394,000, a bonus of \u00a3201,000 and a pension contribution of \u00a345,000. This was a \u00a342,000 increase on his package of \u00a3598,000 in 2011. Prime Minister David Cameron earns \u00a3142,500 a year. The figures were released days before Sport England announced its decision to withhold three years' funding from the LTA for grassroots tennis. The number of people playing tennis once a week has fallen from 487,500 in 2008 to 445,100 in 2012, and Sport England decided to give the LTA just one year's funding of \u00a37.1m. \"This report from Sport England means what the LTA is doing, or failing to do, is absolutely unacceptable,\" added Baroness Billingham, who is urging sports minister Hugh Robertson to demand a meeting with Draper so he can explain himself. \"The people who can hire and fire are the board of the LTA, but I see no sign whatsoever that they are moving to even chastise Roger Draper.\" Sport England chief executive Jennie Price said a further \u00a310.3m could be available to the LTA if it proves it has credible plans for how to improve participation in the sport. \"We need to give them a year to step up their game and prove they can deliver it,\" she said.

Mr Agius quit earlier this month due to the Libor fixing scandal, but then had to take on the running of the company following the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined \u00c2\u00a3290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans.

He received a basic wage of \u00a3394,000, a bonus of \u00a3201,000 and a pension contribution of \u00a345,000. This was a \u00a342,000 increase on his package of \u00a3598,000 in 2011. Prime Minister David Cameron earns \u00a3142,500 a year.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death.

Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine.

He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England.

He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively.

A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\".

He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively.

To calculate this, we can find the probability of each die showing a 1 and subtract it from 1. Assuming each side of the six-sided die and four-sided die is equally likely, the probability of a six-sided die showing a 1 is 1/6 and the probability of a four-sided die showing a 1 is 1/4.

Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined \u00c2\u00a3290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm.

If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\"Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava 100 m (330 ft) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii.

The company is facing some 11,700 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products. Leavitt\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Satterley, accused J&J in his opening statement of knowingly selling a dangerous product, according to an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. \u201cThe evidence will show that J&J knew about the asbestos risk and they continued to sell the product, giving consumers no opportunity to protect themselves,\u201d he said. A lawyer for co-defendant Imerys Talc America, a unit of French Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), told the jury the evidence would show there is no asbestos in its talc and that Leavitt\u2019s disease was not caused by its product. A lawyer for J&J will make his opening remarks on Tuesday. \u201cOur talc is safe and does not contain asbestos. For decades, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder has repeatedly been tested and been found not to contain asbestos,\u201d the company said in response to a request for comment on Monday. J&J and Imerys have argued in court that decades of studies have shown their products to be safe and asbestos-free. Leavitt\u2019s is the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing internal J&J documents showing talc in the company\u2019s raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. The report prompted a stock selloff on fears of J&J\u2019s liability. Shares on Monday closed at $127.01, 14 percent below their Dec. 13 value. While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Leavitt\u2019s case is being tried by the same team of lawyers, including Satterley, who in April 2018 won a $117 million award by a New Jersey jury for a man who blamed his mesothelioma on J&J\u2019s cosmetic talc. That verdict is under appeal. In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal. Leavitt was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. She was born in the Philippines and claims she was exposed to J&J cosmetic talc that originated from South Korea mines during the first two years of her life before her parents moved back to the United States in 1968, Satterley said on Monday. He said testing of Asian talc samples from the 1960s and 1970s by his own expert would show Korean-mined talc tested positive for asbestos fibers, as has talc from U.S. sources. J&J in court filings in the Leavitt case said that fibers found in the Korean talc or any of its other cosmetic talc could not be classified as asbestos and referred to them as non-asbestos forms that its experts say are harmless. Geologically, some asbestos can occur as \u201cnon-asbestiform\u201d rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits. The company in its Monday statement did not specifically address the allegations surrounding the South Korean mine.

While Underwood is no fan of President Donald Trump, she said her No. 1 concern \u2014 and the top concern of the voters she hopes to will send her to Washington \u2014 is access to health care. Attacking the Republican president hard just isn\u2019t necessarily a winning play in Illinois\u2019 14th congressional district, said Underwood, who served as an adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services under Democratic President Barack Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about him that much. He has a higher approval rating than my congressman does, so we talk about our congressman,\u201d said Underwood, who\u2019s hoping to oust incumbent Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren in a district that narrowly backed Trump two years ago. Other Democrats aiming to flip House seats say they\u2019re also trying to zero in on policy more than the president. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has its hopes pinned on 50-plus candidates looking to upend enough seats \u2014 23 \u2014 to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP for the first time in eight years. Republicans have their own plan to retain control, but Democrats are banking they have more than just both momentum and history on their side. U.S. Rep. Denny Heck is helping lead the effort to flip the House. The Washington Democrat said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee can assist candidates with a range of tasks \u2014 from tapping into a national donor base to aiding with the basic mechanics of building a campaign. But he warned that trash-talking Trump will get a candidate only so far. \u201cWhat candidates ought to be doing is talking about that crowded freeway that they need to get additional funds to widen or additional funds to provide mass transit for, or that lake that is becoming polluted and they need the EPA to step up,\u201d Heck said. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is also on the \u201cRed to Blue\u201d list. Mucarsel-Powell, who came from Ecuador as an immigrant with her mother, said Florida\u2019s 26th Congressional District \u2014 the state\u2019s southernmost district \u2014 is one of the most vulnerable for Republicans in the country. She pointed to a 16-point win by Hillary Clinton there in 2016. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo. While Mucarsel-Powell doesn\u2019t shy away from talking about Trump, she says she\u2019s more focused on the struggles of local residents. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to health care. They don\u2019t have good quality education,\u201d she said, adding that tens of thousands depend on the Obama 2010 health care law that Republicans have worked to undo. Talk of a Democratic blue wave is overblown, according to Matt Gorman, communication director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said the committee \u2014 which has its own \u201cYoung Guns\u201d program \u2014 is raising impressive sums and has battle-tested incumbents who know they\u2019re going to be targets. Gorman said the NRCC is also urging candidates to run on local issues and not focus on the latest headlines on cable new or Twitter. He said polling shows the party is in better shape than many assume. \u201cThis is going to be a fight and certainly we\u2019re going to work like we\u2019re 10 points down as we do every day, but for the bedwetters out there who are claiming that all hope is loss I would encourage them to actually look at the data,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple math.\u201d Democratic Rep. Katherine Clark, who is also heading up the DCCC\u2019s \u201cRed to Blue\u201d initiative, said many candidates she\u2019s been working with are more eager to dig into what\u2019s on the minds of voters than taking swipes at Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned with talking about Donald Trump as much as they are about talking about how people in their communities want their children to have job opportunities in the communities that they grew up in,\u201d Clark said. While defeating Trump may galvanize the Democratic faithful, the party is still fumbling for a wider unifying message, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor and former political media consultant. And Democrats may have trouble finding issues, local or not, for voters to latch onto in November. \u201cThe problem is that unemployment is low, economic confidence is relatively high, so to tell people you\u2019ve never had it so bad when compared to eight years ago they\u2019ve got it pretty good, that\u2019s sort of also a tough road to hoe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats may have history on the side. The question is A, will they blow it? And B, is Trump such an anomaly that history is being rewritten?\u201d Roxane Pirayesh, a 32-year-old from Sacramento, California, who works for an education nonprofit, said in the end, the pitch from Democrats has to be more than just an anti-Trump drumbeat \u2014 and she\u2019s not sure everyone\u2019s gotten the message. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably the biggest flaw coming out of the Democratic Party,\u201d she said.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump\\nThey work hard and campaign with a thump\\nTheir goal is clear, to bring change and reform\\nWith determination, they weather any storm\\nUnited they stand, ready to fight\\nFor a better future, with all their might\nTask 3 output: The positions of two consecutive words that have been swapped in the sentence are: 'trash-talking Trump' and 'They work hard'"}, {"instruction": "Correct the grammar errors in the given sentence. and then Write a compressed version of the poem in one sentence. and then Generate a question given a passage that mentions people, places, or things in the compressed version of the poem.", "input": "['now', 'that', 'we', 'understand', 'ortho-para', 'directors', \"let's\", 'take', 'a', 'look', 'at', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'a', 'meta', 'director', 'and', 'so', 'we', 'start', 'with', 'nitrobenzene', 'and', 'if', 'our', 'goal', 'is', 'to', 'nitrate', 'nitrobenzene', 'alright', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'add', 'something', 'like', 'fuming', 'nitric', 'acid', 'sulfuric', 'acid', 'as', 'our', 'catalyst', 'and', 'we', 'also', 'need', 'to', 'heat', 'it', 'up', 'so', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'force', 'this', 'reaction', 'to', 'occur', 'because', 'nitro', 'benzene', 'turns', 'out', 'to', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'reactive', 'as', 'benzene', 'itself', 'and', 'so', 'the', 'end', 'result', 'is', 'to', 'add', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the', 'meta', 'position', 'right', 'so', 'we', 'added', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the']", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: ['Now', 'that', 'we', 'understand', 'ortho/para', 'directors,', \"let's\", 'take', 'a', 'look', 'at', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'a', 'meta', 'director.', 'And', 'so', 'we', 'start', 'with', 'nitrobenzene.', 'And', 'if', 'our', 'goal', 'is', 'to', 'nitrate', 'nitrobenzene', 'alright', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'add', 'something', 'like', 'fuming', 'nitric', 'acid,', 'sulfuric', 'acid', 'as', 'our', 'catalyst,', 'and', 'we', 'also', 'need', 'to', 'heat', 'it', 'up.', 'So', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'force', 'this', 'reaction', 'to', 'occur', 'because', 'nitro', 'benzene', 'turns', 'out', 'to', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'reactive', 'as', 'benzene', 'itself.', 'And', 'so', 'the', 'end', 'result', 'is', 'to', 'add', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'into', 'the', 'meta', 'position', 'right', 'so', 'we', 'added', 'a', 'nitro', 'group', 'onto', 'the']\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: RDF triplets: (ortho/para directors, understand, we), (ortho/para directors, take, look), (ortho/para directors, start, nitrobenzene), (ortho/para directors, need, add), (ortho/para directors, need, heat), (ortho/para directors, need, force), (ortho/para directors, need, occur), (ortho/para directors, turns out, be), (ortho/para directors, add, nitro group), (ortho/para directors, add, nitro group onto), (ortho/para directors, add, nitro group onto the)\nTask 3 output: Ortho/para directors are a group of molecules that have the ability to understand the process of adding a nitro group onto a molecule.

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416\u2013359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359\u2013299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

Order 0.5 size larger than you usually wear, and they won't hurt or give you blisters even around the toe. Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute., Review_6: I bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding. They matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable. I wore these shoes longer than I have worn any heels. The lower heel gave me just enough height, but not to much to make me unsteady. Looking forward to wearing them again and again!, Review_7: These shoes run appropriate to size (I'm a size 9), but I felt like they pinched my toes as I have a wider foot. The shorter heel is nice so you don't have to worry about tripping- but I sent them back as I didn't find them comfortable., Review_8: Great Fast Amazon shipping, and the show itself is a really nice bright yellow, perfect for that pop of color I was looking for.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920\u201321 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416\u2013359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359\u2013299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Simplifying the sentence: Using a statistical model, we analyzed the performance of influenza surveillance systems in Hong Kong based on the collected data.\nTask 3 output: Based on the collected data, the analysis of influenza surveillance systems in Hong Kong took 10 minutes."}, {"instruction": "Decompose a yes/no question into a series of sub-questions that can be answered using Wikipedia articles.

The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said preliminary data show that the ACOs produced $380 million in savings vis-a-vis traditional Medicare in 2012 by giving doctors and other healthcare providers the incentive to focus on improved outcomes for patients instead of fees from tests and services. Medicare, the $575 billion government healthcare system for 51 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, faces growing financial pressures as a result of America\u2019s aging population. A mainstay, the trust fund that pays for hospitalization, is expected to be exhausted in 2026. Deficit hawks view Medicare as a future driver of the federal debt and have called for major systemic reforms. But the Obama administration has pursued gradual changes including the reform of care delivery systems. So-called fee-for-service medicine is widely viewed as a cause of rising healthcare costs, because it calls for paying healthcare providers for tests and services that are sometimes unnecessary. Obamacare seeks to tackle costs by exploring ACOs and other new healthcare business models intended to find savings that do not jeopardize care. A main goal is to generate savings large enough to be shared between Medicare and providers. But some experts are skeptical, saying significant cost reductions could be hard to maintain over time. But CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, runs two different ACO programs. In its largest, 54 of 114 ACO networks achieved lower than expected expenditures. But only 29 saw savings big enough to share with providers. All told, the program produced $128 million in net savings for Medicare\u2019s trust funds. \u201cOverall, the ACO program\u2019s a net saver to the Medicare program,\u201d CMS principal deputy administrator Jon Blum told reporters in a conference call. \u201cIt\u2019s giving us great confidence that this is the right course for the Medicare program and we are confident that it will continue to show quality improvement and cost savings.\u201d  Officials said the ACOs also achieved a wide range of quality goals. But CMS released no quality statistics. Thursday\u2019s government release drew some cautious optimism from the healthcare industry. \u201cToday\u2019s report reflects important steps. More work is needed to modernize our antiquated Medicare payment system and base payment on evidence-based quality measures and proven patient outcomes,\u201d said Dr. John Noseworthy, chief executive of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which is not part of the government\u2019s program. \u201cAs results of the team-based care models are analyzed, those most effective in driving down health care costs without compromising safety and quality should become part of the healthcare system,\u201d he said.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand M\u0101ori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the name of the person who rarely worked with Heseltine, although they had much in common?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Who is the individual who seldom collaborated with Heseltine, despite sharing many similarities?\nTask 3 output: Domain: Question"}, {"instruction": "Identify the word with a typo in the given sentence. and then Generate a natural language interpretation of the given SQL statement involving logical operations on a table. and then Generate supporting facts for a given natural language interpretation and its correct answer.", "input": "A gropu of people riding on a cart traveling down a street.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: gropu\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: group\nTask 3 output: Group of friends playing in the park running and laughing and having fun together"}, {"instruction": "Create a pair of sentences that clearly contradict each other.

Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored.

He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \"What Music Is\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from Bart\u00f3k, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered  to be  among his finest work.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the last name of the composer who indicated that the man who moved to Ireland to forestall conscription interest in the occult turned into studies in religious philosophies?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The composer's last name who indicated that the man who moved to Ireland to forestall conscription interest in the occult turned into studies in religious philosophies is unknown.\nTask 3 output: composer's last name indicated"}, {"instruction": "Generate a story based on the given prompt. and then Elaborate the story by providing more details, using specific language, and adding additional information without changing the overall meaning. and then Determine if the elaborated story has proper punctuation.

There was no discussion in the story about whether there are different costs associated with the procedure itself. The story explained that the through-the-wrist approach was associated with lower risk of bleeding and shorter hospitalizations but should have included a caveat explanation about the strength of research and that the results of the study reported on require follow-up investigation. The story mentioned risk of bleeding at the site of catheter insertion as a possible harm of treatment which was greater for those who had a the catheter inserted in the leg. To its credit, the story provided absolute risk information, i.e. pointing out the 60% reduction in bleeding was the difference between 2 and 1% of patients having this complication. The story did not mention whether there were any particular side effects or harms associated with catheter insertion at the wrist. The story explained that the study was an analysis of information contained within a national registry. But it should have explained that this is the weakest type of study from which to draw a clinical conclusion (such as this procedure is safer or as safe as the alternative). Thus the statement in the story \u2018both methods were equally effective\u2019 should have been more tentative. The underlying weakness of the study, that it is not a controlled trial, may mean that the patients who had the wrist approach had something else about them that helped to reduce risk and that the researchers may not have been able to take into consideration. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included interview material from one clinician who was not associated with the study reported on. The quality of the piece would have been improved if it had included input from physicians who might have explained some of the reasons why not all interventional cardiologists use the wrist approach. The story did an adequate job of reporting about a recent study comparing two approaches to angioplasty. The story indicated that the angioplasty using access through the wrist as opposed to a leg, was used much less frequently.vThe story explained that extra training is required in order to use this procedure and many doctors are not trained in this technique. This would contribute to the procedure\u2019s limited availability.

The company is facing some 11,700 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products. Leavitt\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Satterley, accused J&J in his opening statement of knowingly selling a dangerous product, according to an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. \u201cThe evidence will show that J&J knew about the asbestos risk and they continued to sell the product, giving consumers no opportunity to protect themselves,\u201d he said. A lawyer for co-defendant Imerys Talc America, a unit of French Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), told the jury the evidence would show there is no asbestos in its talc and that Leavitt\u2019s disease was not caused by its product. A lawyer for J&J will make his opening remarks on Tuesday. \u201cOur talc is safe and does not contain asbestos. For decades, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder has repeatedly been tested and been found not to contain asbestos,\u201d the company said in response to a request for comment on Monday. J&J and Imerys have argued in court that decades of studies have shown their products to be safe and asbestos-free. Leavitt\u2019s is the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing internal J&J documents showing talc in the company\u2019s raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. The report prompted a stock selloff on fears of J&J\u2019s liability. Shares on Monday closed at $127.01, 14 percent below their Dec. 13 value. While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Leavitt\u2019s case is being tried by the same team of lawyers, including Satterley, who in April 2018 won a $117 million award by a New Jersey jury for a man who blamed his mesothelioma on J&J\u2019s cosmetic talc. That verdict is under appeal. In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal. Leavitt was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. She was born in the Philippines and claims she was exposed to J&J cosmetic talc that originated from South Korea mines during the first two years of her life before her parents moved back to the United States in 1968, Satterley said on Monday. He said testing of Asian talc samples from the 1960s and 1970s by his own expert would show Korean-mined talc tested positive for asbestos fibers, as has talc from U.S. sources. J&J in court filings in the Leavitt case said that fibers found in the Korean talc or any of its other cosmetic talc could not be classified as asbestos and referred to them as non-asbestos forms that its experts say are harmless. Geologically, some asbestos can occur as \u201cnon-asbestiform\u201d rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits. The company in its Monday statement did not specifically address the allegations surrounding the South Korean mine.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Subject: Influenza surveillance systems performance, Predicate: Characterizing, Object: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 3 output: The given text is plausible as it describes the application of a statistical model to surveillance data for monitoring influenza in Hong Kong."}, {"instruction": "Decompose a yes/no question into a series of sub-questions that can be answered using Wikipedia articles.

Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its Os\u00e9 robotic \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d It\u2019s one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad \u201cbooth babes,\u201d fostering a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official \u201cequality partner,\u201d The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. It\u2019s been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startups\u2019 female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Crave\u2019s exhibit included a camper with a \u201cBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,\u201d where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other \u201cfem tech\u201d companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. \u201cLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,\u201d said Barrica, who recently published the book \u201cSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.\u201d Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,\u201d she said. Founders insist that their devices \u2014 ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories \u2014 have effects outside the bedroom. \u201cSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,\u201d said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. \u201cIt does way more than just pleasure. It\u2019s immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.\u201d DiCarlo\u2019s $290 Os\u00e9 device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA\u2019s image.\u201d DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new \u201cInnovation for All\u201d sessions with senior diversity officials. Os\u00e9 began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. \u201cThings are better, but there\u2019s just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,\u201d she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ AP\u2019s CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Sex tech is being showcased at CES in Las Vegas, a year after controversy over a revoked innovation award to a female-led sex device company.\nTask 3 output: The context is appropriate as it describes a current event where sex tech is being showcased at CES in Las Vegas.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416\u2013359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359\u2013299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

He says they signal a \u00a33.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and \u00a31bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around \u00a311bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, according to an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website.\nTask 3 output: 0"}, {"instruction": "Write a short description in natural language for given triples that show the relationship between the elements. and then Generate a title for a research paper based on the given description. and then Classify the research paper into one of the 47 different domains.", "input": "American_Journal_of_Mathematics | abbreviation | \"Am.

GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1).

Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored.

While public health experts are demanding bolder action, most governors and mayors have not imposed mandatory stay-at-home orders. Their apparent reluctance comes amid Bolsonaro\u2019s relentless message for Brazilians to defy regional and local public health efforts to stop the virus\u2019 spread. Stricter lockdowns are needed because Brazilian doctors are now being forced to choose who lives and dies and triage situations could generate social unrest if they increase, said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil\u2019s non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. \u201cWe need to avoid a total disaster,\u201d he said. Lago said mandatory lockdowns across much of the country would help: \u201cIt is late in terms of avoiding hospital collapse, but certainly it isn\u2019t too late to avoid a bigger catastrophe.\u201d Brazil had more than 177,000 confirmed cases on Tuesday, with the actual figure believed to be much higher because of limited testing. Many intensive care hospital units are full and cemeteries are increasingly overwhelmed with bodies. Bolsonaro, who called the virus a \u201clittle flu,\u201d has insisted for more than a month that governors are stoking economic carnage with voluntary quarantine recommendations and urges Brazilians to go about their everyday. He reiterated criticism of governors Tuesday for ignoring his decree that gyms, barbershops and beauty salons should be treated as essential services. Amid Bolsonaro\u2019s rejection of coronavirus danger, most of the country\u2019s 27 governors have criticized his stances but none have imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, the governors have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or deferred to mayors to make those decisions. Governors had been hoping the virus would not spread in Brazil\u2019s warm climate, but their response is also a reflection of Brazil\u2019s political landscape because the governors depend on mayors to endorse re-election campaigns. Many worry that imposing mandatory lockdowns could hurt local leaders in this year\u2019s municipal election, decreasing support for incumbent governors in their 2022 campaigns, said Thiago de Arag\u00e3o, director of strategy of the Arko Advice political consultancy. But as the death toll rose from less than 7,000 to more than 10,000 last week, local authorities began adopting stricter anti-virus measures. The riverside community of Tefe in the Amazon region was among the first, with a lockdown decree specifying criminal charges for residents leaving home except for visits to hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets. The mayor imposed it because only about half of Tefe\u2019s 60,000 residents complied with an earlier recommendation by the governor of Amazonas state to take virus precautions. Those who did not comply \u201cthink they\u2019re immortal, that they won\u2019t get it,\u201d Tefe Mayor Normando Bessa de S\u00e1 said on Facebook. Over the next three days, the governors of the northern and northeastern states of Maranhao, Para and Ceara decreed lockdowns for their capital cities as intensive-care units filled with COVID-19 patients. Despite the new lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo still don\u2019t have mandatory stay-at-home-orders at the state or city level \u2014 even though they are the hardest hit places in Brazil. Lockdowns \u201cshould have been imposed at least three weeks ago, when the epidemic was already increasing, but not at this speed that it is now,\u201d said Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory physician and researcher with the widely respected Oswaldo Cruz Foundation biological research group. \u201cI gave that recommendation more than once,\u201d said Dalcolmo, among the experts on a COVID-19 panel that advises Rio\u2019s governor. Rio Gov. Wilson Witzel has decreed non-binding quarantine recommendations and commerce restrictions through the end of May. He pledged to make police available so the state\u2019s 92 mayors can enact lockdowns, instead of imposing them himself. In another example of Brazil\u2019s scattershot local lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella on Monday prohibited non-residents from entering 11 neighborhoods and ordered the closure of all businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies in the teeming slums called favelas. \u201cPeople still haven\u2019t perceived the need to avoid gatherings, stay home,\u201d Crivella complained. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems. The cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo near Rio on Monday authorized fines and criminal charges for violating stay-at-home orders. Niteroi police took the temperatures of those entering the city, and put a man and his two dogs inside a police van after he allegedly refused to show documents to justify being out of his home. In Sao Paulo state, Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria last month urged but did not require residents to self-quarantine while shutting down schools and most businesses. Nearly 70% of the state\u2019s 44 million people initially complied, but that dropped below 50% in recent weeks, according to cellphone carrier data provided by the state. Doria, a presidential hopeful, saw his popularity increase as he challenged Bolsonaro. But police stopped enforcing his recommendations after Bolsonaro criticized the handcuffing and detention of a middle-aged woman exercising in a park who resisted removal. With noncompliance rising, Doria said last week that \u201cif we need to step up to a lockdown, we will not hesitate.\u201d Sao Paulo\u2019s mayor this week limited vehicles circulating in the city to 50% of the normal flow. Television images showed long lines of people entering crammed buses with standing room only in clear violation of social distancing guidelines. Public health analysts from the Imperial College London, whose COVID-19 research has guided global policymakers, last week called Brazil\u2019s anti-virus efforts \u201cpartially successful.\u201d \u201cIn the absence of the introduction of further control measures that will more strongly curb transmission, Brazil faces the prospect of an epidemic that will continue to grow exponentially,\u201d they wrote. ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Brazil cities lurch to lockdowns amid virus crisis red flags.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Brazil {NOUN} cities {NOUN} lurch {VERB} to {PART} lockdowns {NOUN} amid {ADP} virus {NOUN} crisis {NOUN} red {ADJ} flags {NOUN}.\nTask 3 output: Spam"}, {"instruction": "Elaborate the given sentence by providing more details, using specific language, and adding additional information without changing the overall meaning. and then Summarize the article in one sentence based on the elaborated sentence. and then Extract the words and the relationship between them from the given phrase.

Recent algorithmic developments have yielded several sub-quadratic methods that use an approximation to the least squares TD solution, but incur bias. In this paper, we propose a new family of accelerated gradient TD (ATD) methods that (1) provide similar data efficiency benefits to least-squares methods, at a fraction of the computation and storage (2) significantly reduce parameter sensitivity compared to linear TD methods, and (3) are asymptotically unbiased.

Mr Agius quit earlier this month due to the Libor fixing scandal, but then had to take on the running of the company following the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined \u00c2\u00a3290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory.

Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment.

He says they signal a \u00a33.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and \u00a31bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around \u00a311bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, according to an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website.\nTask 3 output: In a shocking revelation, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website has revealed that universities in England are set to face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the upcoming Spending Review.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its Os\u00e9 robotic \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d It\u2019s one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad \u201cbooth babes,\u201d fostering a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official \u201cequality partner,\u201d The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. It\u2019s been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startups\u2019 female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Crave\u2019s exhibit included a camper with a \u201cBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,\u201d where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other \u201cfem tech\u201d companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. \u201cLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,\u201d said Barrica, who recently published the book \u201cSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.\u201d Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,\u201d she said. Founders insist that their devices \u2014 ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories \u2014 have effects outside the bedroom. \u201cSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,\u201d said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. \u201cIt does way more than just pleasure. It\u2019s immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.\u201d DiCarlo\u2019s $290 Os\u00e9 device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA\u2019s image.\u201d DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new \u201cInnovation for All\u201d sessions with senior diversity officials. Os\u00e9 began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. \u201cThings are better, but there\u2019s just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,\u201d she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ AP\u2019s CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Sex tech is impressing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers praised an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 3 output: Technology"}, {"instruction": "Provide a justification for the coreference between a pronoun and a noun phrase in a sentence.

His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon.

Analysis of these cDNAs has enabled us to determine the entire structure of the human Golli-MBP gene. The Golli-MBP gene, which encompasses the MBP transcription unit, is approximately 179 kb in length and consists of 10 exons, seven of which constitute the MBP gene. The human Golli-MBP gene contains two transcription start sites, each of which gives rise to a family of alternatively spliced transcripts. At least two Golli-MBP transcripts, containing the first three exons of the gene and one or more MBP exons, are produced from the first transcription start site. The second family of transcripts contains only MBP exons and produces the well-known MBPs. In humans, RNA blot analysis revealed that Golli-MBP transcripts were expressed in fetal thymus, spleen, and human B-cell and macrophage cell lines, as well as in fetal spinal cord. These findings clearly link the expression of exons encoding the autoimmunogen/encephalitogen MBP in the central nervous system to cells and tissues of the immune system through normal expression of the Golli-MBP gene.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Simplifying the sentence: Using a statistical model, we analyzed the performance of influenza surveillance systems in Hong Kong based on the collected data.\nTask 3 output: Simplificant la frase: Utilitzant un model estad\u00edstic, hem analitzat el rendiment dels sistemes de vigil\u00e0ncia de la grip a Hong Kong basant-nos en les dades recopilades."}, {"instruction": "Fill in the blank with a word that completes the sentence. and then Fix the SQL query based on the given natural language interpretation. and then Generate an incorrect form of the fixed SQL query.", "input": "PersonX finds ___ to express", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: wound\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a young boy named Jack.

Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon.

Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand M\u0101ori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the name of the person who rarely worked with Heseltine, although they had much in common?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Who is the individual who seldom collaborated with Heseltine, despite sharing many similarities?\nTask 3 output: Who is the individual who seldom collaborated with Heseltine, despite sharing many similarities?"}, {"instruction": "Follow a sequence of instructions and perform basic logic and conditionals. and then Generate a story based on the given negative review. and then Translate the given negative review to Panjabi without omitting or adding any information.", "input": "Repeat all the world seven times, and after every second time add is a stage.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: all the world all the world is a stage all the world all the world is a stage all the world all the world is a stage all the world\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: All the world is a stage, and it is a beautiful stage.

Initially, the absorption of toxic metal ions is limited by cell membrane exclusion. Ions that are absorbed into tissues are sequestered in cell vacuoles. This sequestration mechanism is facilitated by proteins on the vacuole membrane.Chemical priming has been proposed to increase tolerance to abiotic stresses in crop plants. In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: In a greenhouse, a botanist has just finished planting two of the same kind of plant.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death. Sewell was unaware of his father's identity until 1986.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer is Smith.

GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Targeting A20 Decreases Glioma Stem Cell Survival and Tumor Growth\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Subject: Targeting A20, Predicate: Decreases, Object: Glioma Stem Cell Survival; Subject: Targeting A20, Predicate: Decreases, Object: Tumor Growth\nTask 3 output: Cancer"}, {"instruction": "Generate a short summary of a Reddit post that includes a humorous situation. and then Detect if the corrected sentence contains the elicit-pref strategy in a negotiation conversation. and then Determine if the corrected sentence is ironic or not based on the given definition of irony.", "input": "Text: last week a close girl friend of mine(lets call her tina) and i went to a bar to see a band play. while i was there i bought some adderall off a friend i knew to help me study for an exam. we had some drinks, had a good time, and went home. while driving home we are going through an intersection and get blind-sided by a girl going the wrong way down a one way(a normally very busy three lane one way). at first tina got very angry. storms over to her car but then sees that she is just a confused girl who just moved to the city and she calms down and they begin to talk rationally. out of nowhere a homeless man comes over and starts defending this girl who hit us. says that it was tina's fault and he will back up this girl when the police arrive. before tina is able to say anything another homeless/crackhead couple comes over to defend tina. now the homeless people are arguing with each other and the two girls are staring in shock. the homeless man defending tina begins to take off his shirt as if he is going to fight this other man. tina steps in between them and says something along the lines of \"get the fuck outta here\". the couple walks away and she continues talking with this girl. during this whole scene i had ran across the street to stash the adderall i had bought earlier. as i am walking back from the bushes i watch as the couple gets into tina's car with three other guys and starts driving away. i tried to run after the car but i was too far away. i am now watching her car billowing black smoke as they speed down the road. i walk over to tina and we are so blown away by what had happened that we basically start laughing. it took a while before the reality set in and at that point the worst was assumed. her car was stolen and everything in it. the car was found less than a mile away with most of her valuables stolen and the rear of the car melted from a fire. her car was totaled and irreplaceable things were lost. the good news is that they didn't steal her $1000 skis and the insurance money from a stolen vehicle far outweighs a basic fender-bender.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: instead of watching over my friends car after we got into an accident i was stashing my drugs in a bush and the car was stolen by crackheads.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: John and his friends were driving back home after a fun night out.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Simplifying the sentence: Using a statistical model, we analyzed the performance of influenza surveillance systems in Hong Kong based on the collected data.\nTask 3 output: We analyzed the performance of influenza surveillance systems in Hong Kong using a statistical model and collected data."}, {"instruction": "Identify a common noun phrase or event in three given sentences and provide the corresponding span of text for each sentence. and then Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, while still maintaining the context and relationship between the objects in the question.

There are two main factors about a medium that will determine the speed of the sound wave through that medium. One is the stiffness of the medium or how rigid it is. The stiffer the medium, the faster the sound waves will travel through it. This is because in a stiff material, each molecule is more interconnected to the other molecules around it. So any disturbance gets transmitted faster down the line. The other factor that determines the speed of sound is the temperature of the medium. As the temperature increases, the molecules in the medium gain more energy and move faster, which allows sound waves to travel faster. Therefore, changing the temperature of the medium can also change the speed of sound."}, {"instruction": "Generate a fact related to the given fact, based on the given topic word.

It plays a crucial role in plant growth and development as it serves as a rich source of nitrogen, which is an essential nutrient for plants. When plants absorb urea, it undergoes a process called hydrolysis, where it is converted into ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia is then further converted into nitrate ions, which can be readily taken up by plants through their roots. This uptake of nitrogen from urea helps plants to synthesize proteins, enzymes, and chlorophyll, ultimately leading to their healthy growth and vibrant appearance. So, urea not only helps plants grow but also contributes to their overall happiness and well-being."}, {"instruction": "Break down a question into a list of steps required to answer it.

GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Targeting A20 Decreases Glioma Stem Cell Survival and Tumor Growth\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Subject: Targeting A20, Predicate: Decreases, Object: Glioma Stem Cell Survival; Subject: Targeting A20, Predicate: Decreases, Object: Tumor Growth\nTask 3 output: In a laboratory, scientists are conducting experiments to target A20, which decreases glioma stem cell survival.

He says they signal a \u00a33.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and \u00a31bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around \u00a311bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of four point two billion pounds in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 3 output: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2 billion in the coming Spending Review, according to an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website."}, {"instruction": "Convert text numbers in a passage into digit form. and then Write a compressed version of the passage with digit numbers in one sentence. and then Provide a justification for the coreference between the pronoun and the noun phrase in the sentence.

Initially, the absorption of toxic metal ions is limited by cell membrane exclusion. Ions that are absorbed into tissues are sequestered in cell vacuoles. This sequestration mechanism is facilitated by proteins on the vacuole membrane.Chemical priming has been proposed to increase tolerance to abiotic stresses in crop plants. In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: In a greenhouse, a botanist has just finished planting two of the same kind of plant.

Mr Agius quit earlier this month due to the Libor fixing scandal, but then had to take on the running of the company following the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined \u00c2\u00a3290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

He says they signal a \u00a33.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and \u00a31bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around \u00a311bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of four point two billion pounds in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 3 output: According to a leaked email to the BBC News website, universities in England are expected to experience funding reductions of \u00a34.2 billion in the upcoming Spending Review."}, {"instruction": "Generate a natural language interpretation of a given command involving logical operations on a table. and then Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, while still maintaining the context and relationship between the objects in the question.

METHODS AND RESULTS In 30 obese subjects (age 42\u00b111 years, body mass index 46\u00b111 kg/m(2)) undergoing bariatric surgery, we intraoperatively collected visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and characterized depot-specific adipose phenotypes. We assessed vasomotor function of the adipose microvasculature using videomicroscopy of small arterioles (75-250 \u03bcm) isolated from different fat compartments. Endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation was severely impaired in visceral arterioles, compared to the subcutaneous depot (P<0.001 by ANOVA). Nonendothelium dependent responses to papaverine and nitroprusside were similar. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester reduced subcutaneous vasodilation but had no effect on severely blunted visceral arteriolar responses. Visceral fat exhibited greater expression of proinflammatory, oxidative stress-related, hypoxia-induced, and proangiogenic genes; increased activated macrophage populations; and had a higher capacity for cytokine production ex vivo.     CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide clinical evidence that the visceral microenvironment may be intrinsically toxic to arterial health providing a potential mechanism by which visceral adiposity burden is linked to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Our findings also support the evolving concept that both adipose tissue quality and quantity may play significant roles in shaping cardiovascular phenotypes in human obesity.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Arteriolar function in visceral adipose tissue is impaired in human obesity.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Arteriolar function in visceral adipose tissue is impaired in humans with obesity.\nTask 3 output: Unrelated"}, {"instruction": "Decompose a yes/no question into a series of sub-questions that can be answered using Wikipedia articles.

Mr Agius quit earlier this month due to the Libor fixing scandal, but then had to take on the running of the company following the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond. Barclays has been under pressure to appoint someone from outside the bank. Several top shareholders had protested at the prospect of Sir Michael's appointment, according to the Reuters news agency. Favoured candidates have begun to emerge for both top jobs at Barclays, BBC business editor Robert Peston says, although the selection process is still at an early stage. The former head of the civil service, Lord O'Donnell, is the board of the bank's preferred choice as new chairman. And Bill Winters, the former JP Morgan banker, is the front-runner to succeed Bob Diamond as chief executive of the bank. It is not clear whether either would actually take it, our correspondent says. But whoever gets appointed can expect to come under close scrutiny from the regulatory authorities, including the Bank of England, whose governor Sir Mervyn King played a crucial role in the departure of Bob Diamond. By Robert PestonBusiness editor Sir Michael's decision was announced by Easyjet, for whom he is chairman. He is also chairman of BT Group. He would have had to give up both of these roles if he had taken the top job at Barclays. Easyjet said that Sir Michael had informed its board and Mr Agius that he did not wish to be a candidate to fill the vacancy at Barclays. It may mean that Mr Agius, who has been chairman for five and a half years, has to stay on even longer than originally planned while a successor is sought. Remaining candidates are said to include the former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell, and Glen Moreno, the chairman of publishers Pearson and former deputy chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Agius, Mr Diamond and Barclays chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all stepped down at the beginning of July after the bank was fined \u00c2\u00a3290m by the UK and US regulatory authorities for manipulating Libor - a key benchmark interest rate in the global financial markets - over many years.

While public health experts are demanding bolder action, most governors and mayors have not imposed mandatory stay-at-home orders. Their apparent reluctance comes amid Bolsonaro\u2019s relentless message for Brazilians to defy regional and local public health efforts to stop the virus\u2019 spread. Stricter lockdowns are needed because Brazilian doctors are now being forced to choose who lives and dies and triage situations could generate social unrest if they increase, said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil\u2019s non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. \u201cWe need to avoid a total disaster,\u201d he said. Lago said mandatory lockdowns across much of the country would help: \u201cIt is late in terms of avoiding hospital collapse, but certainly it isn\u2019t too late to avoid a bigger catastrophe.\u201d Brazil had more than 177,000 confirmed cases on Tuesday, with the actual figure believed to be much higher because of limited testing. Many intensive care hospital units are full and cemeteries are increasingly overwhelmed with bodies. Bolsonaro, who called the virus a \u201clittle flu,\u201d has insisted for more than a month that governors are stoking economic carnage with voluntary quarantine recommendations and urges Brazilians to go about their everyday. He reiterated criticism of governors Tuesday for ignoring his decree that gyms, barbershops and beauty salons should be treated as essential services. Amid Bolsonaro\u2019s rejection of coronavirus danger, most of the country\u2019s 27 governors have criticized his stances but none have imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, the governors have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or deferred to mayors to make those decisions. Governors had been hoping the virus would not spread in Brazil\u2019s warm climate, but their response is also a reflection of Brazil\u2019s political landscape because the governors depend on mayors to endorse re-election campaigns. Many worry that imposing mandatory lockdowns could hurt local leaders in this year\u2019s municipal election, decreasing support for incumbent governors in their 2022 campaigns, said Thiago de Arag\u00e3o, director of strategy of the Arko Advice political consultancy. But as the death toll rose from less than 7,000 to more than 10,000 last week, local authorities began adopting stricter anti-virus measures. The riverside community of Tefe in the Amazon region was among the first, with a lockdown decree specifying criminal charges for residents leaving home except for visits to hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets. The mayor imposed it because only about half of Tefe\u2019s 60,000 residents complied with an earlier recommendation by the governor of Amazonas state to take virus precautions. Those who did not comply \u201cthink they\u2019re immortal, that they won\u2019t get it,\u201d Tefe Mayor Normando Bessa de S\u00e1 said on Facebook. Over the next three days, the governors of the northern and northeastern states of Maranhao, Para and Ceara decreed lockdowns for their capital cities as intensive-care units filled with COVID-19 patients. Despite the new lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo still don\u2019t have mandatory stay-at-home-orders at the state or city level \u2014 even though they are the hardest hit places in Brazil. Lockdowns \u201cshould have been imposed at least three weeks ago, when the epidemic was already increasing, but not at this speed that it is now,\u201d said Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory physician and researcher with the widely respected Oswaldo Cruz Foundation biological research group. \u201cI gave that recommendation more than once,\u201d said Dalcolmo, among the experts on a COVID-19 panel that advises Rio\u2019s governor. Rio Gov. Wilson Witzel has decreed non-binding quarantine recommendations and commerce restrictions through the end of May. He pledged to make police available so the state\u2019s 92 mayors can enact lockdowns, instead of imposing them himself. In another example of Brazil\u2019s scattershot local lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella on Monday prohibited non-residents from entering 11 neighborhoods and ordered the closure of all businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies in the teeming slums called favelas. \u201cPeople still haven\u2019t perceived the need to avoid gatherings, stay home,\u201d Crivella complained. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems. The cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo near Rio on Monday authorized fines and criminal charges for violating stay-at-home orders. Niteroi police took the temperatures of those entering the city, and put a man and his two dogs inside a police van after he allegedly refused to show documents to justify being out of his home. In Sao Paulo state, Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria last month urged but did not require residents to self-quarantine while shutting down schools and most businesses. Nearly 70% of the state\u2019s 44 million people initially complied, but that dropped below 50% in recent weeks, according to cellphone carrier data provided by the state. Doria, a presidential hopeful, saw his popularity increase as he challenged Bolsonaro. But police stopped enforcing his recommendations after Bolsonaro criticized the handcuffing and detention of a middle-aged woman exercising in a park who resisted removal. With noncompliance rising, Doria said last week that \u201cif we need to step up to a lockdown, we will not hesitate.\u201d Sao Paulo\u2019s mayor this week limited vehicles circulating in the city to 50% of the normal flow. Television images showed long lines of people entering crammed buses with standing room only in clear violation of social distancing guidelines. Public health analysts from the Imperial College London, whose COVID-19 research has guided global policymakers, last week called Brazil\u2019s anti-virus efforts \u201cpartially successful.\u201d \u201cIn the absence of the introduction of further control measures that will more strongly curb transmission, Brazil faces the prospect of an epidemic that will continue to grow exponentially,\u201d they wrote. ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Brazil cities lurch to lockdowns amid virus crisis red flags.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: As the COVID-19 crisis continues to escalate in Brazil, cities across the country are implementing strict lockdown measures.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its Os\u00e9 robotic \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d It\u2019s one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad \u201cbooth babes,\u201d fostering a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official \u201cequality partner,\u201d The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. It\u2019s been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startups\u2019 female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Crave\u2019s exhibit included a camper with a \u201cBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,\u201d where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other \u201cfem tech\u201d companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. \u201cLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,\u201d said Barrica, who recently published the book \u201cSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.\u201d Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,\u201d she said. Founders insist that their devices \u2014 ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories \u2014 have effects outside the bedroom. \u201cSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,\u201d said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. \u201cIt does way more than just pleasure. It\u2019s immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.\u201d DiCarlo\u2019s $290 Os\u00e9 device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA\u2019s image.\u201d DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new \u201cInnovation for All\u201d sessions with senior diversity officials. Os\u00e9 began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. \u201cThings are better, but there\u2019s just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,\u201d she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ AP\u2019s CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Sex tech is being showcased at CES in Las Vegas, a year after controversy over a revoked innovation award to a female-led sex device company.\nTask 3 output: The given text is plausible and matches common sense.

At a gas station in the desert, they meet an attendant named Jeb, who tells them of a short-cut through the hills.  Not long after taking the supposed short-cut, their tires are punctured by a hidden spike strip. Doug and Bob go look for help, while the rest of the family stays behind. Beauty escapes from the trailer and, when Bobby chases her into the hills, he finds her mutilated body cut open. Frightened, he runs and falls, knocking himself unconscious. A young female mutant named Ruby finds him and protects him from her brother Goggle. As Doug heads towards the interstate, he finds a huge crater filled with numerous abandoned cars and other items. Meanwhile, Bob arrives back at the gas station, which appears to be open yet isolated. Inside, he finds news clippings detailing various disappearances that have occurred in the area and realizes the attendant purposefully led them to danger by suggesting they take the short-cut. He also finds a severed ear and flees from the station. Outside, he finds a hysterical Jeb, who commits suicide in front of him. Bob then attempts to flee in an abandoned car, but is attacked by the mutant leader, Papa Jupiter, and dragged into the mining caves by Jupiter, Jupiter's eldest son Lizard, and Pluto.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Who's sister protects a boy from him?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Whose sister protects a boy from him?\nTask 3 output: In a small town, there is a boy named Jack.

He says they signal a \u00a33.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and \u00a31bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around \u00a311bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of four point two billion pounds in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 3 output: Triplets: (Universities in England, face, funding cuts), (Universities in England, face, four point two billion pounds), (Universities in England, face, in the coming Spending Review), (Universities in England, face, leaked to the BBC News website), (Universities in England, face, suggests)"}, {"instruction": "Complete the story by predicting the appropriate last sentence. and then Paraphrase the last sentence while still supporting the question. and then Modify the paraphrased sentence by replacing female or gender-neutral pronouns with male pronouns, or add a male-gendered word if there are no pronouns.", "input": "Sentence1: Caroline was a student in medical school.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was applied to Hong Kong surveillance data to characterize the performance of influenza surveillance systems.\nTask 3 output: \u0a39\u0a3e\u0a02\u0a17 \u0a15\u0a3e\u0a02\u0a17 \u0a26\u0a40 \u0a28\u0a3f\u0a17\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a28\u0a40 \u0a26\u0a3e\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a2c\u0a47\u0a38\u0a40\u0a05\u0a28 \u0a39\u0a3e\u0a07\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a15\u0a32 \u0a38\u0a1f\u0a48\u0a1f\u0a3f\u0a38\u0a1f\u0a3f\u0a15\u0a32 \u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a21\u0a32 \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a32\u0a3e\u0a17\u0a42 \u0a15\u0a40\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a17\u0a3f\u0a06 \u0a39\u0a48 \u0a1c\u0a3f\u0a38 \u0a28\u0a3e\u0a32 \u0a07\u0a70\u0a2b\u0a32\u0a42\u0a10\u0a02\u0a1c\u0a3e \u0a28\u0a3f\u0a17\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a28\u0a40 \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a38\u0a1f\u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a02 \u0a26\u0a40 \u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a26\u0a30\u0a38\u0a3c\u0a28 \u0a28\u0a42\u0a70 \u0a1a\u0a30\u0a1a\u0a3e \u0a15\u0a40\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a17\u0a3f\u0a06 \u0a39\u0a48\u0964"}, {"instruction": "Generate a question based on a list of triplets, replacing the subject and/or object with blanks. and then Generate a topic word that is related to the given question and includes at least one word from the question. and then Determine if the topic word is plausible or matches common sense.", "input": "[['Shelby Fletcher', 'YEARS', '1'], ['[TABLECONTEXT]', 'COACH', 'Shelby Fletcher'], ['Shelby Fletcher', 'RECORD', '1-0'], ['[TABLECONTEXT]', '[TITLE]', 'Alabama Crimson Tide baseball']]", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: _____  served as coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide baseball team for 1 year, with a 1-0 record.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Coach\nTask 3 output: The input is plausible as 'Coach' can refer to a sports coach or a mode of transportation."}, {"instruction": "Generate a fact related to the given fact, based on the given topic word.

And that is the standard,\" Van Gaal said. \"That is why we let him go, because of Falcao, but also to allow the youngsters to fit in. That is the policy. That is why I am here.\" Welbeck joined Arsenal on transfer deadline day in a deal Gunners manager Arsene Wenger revealed almost did not happen. The Manchester-born forward, who scored both goals for England in Monday's 2-0 victory over Switzerland, netted 29 times in 142 United appearances. Welbeck's international team-mate Rooney, 28, has scored 217 goals for United in 445 matches, while Dutchman van Persie, 31, has hit 48 in 78 games. United spent close to \u00a3150m during a summer transfer spree, but also allowed a large number of players to leave. Van Gaal said promoting local young players was a cornerstone of his philosophy at Old Trafford. \"We let 14 players go, we have only brought six players in,\" he added. \"That means there are many positions vacant, they are vacant for the youth. \"I have already used a lot of youngsters in the season and pre-season, so I am always willing to give young players chances - but they have to take the chances. \"The possibility is there. All the youngsters have to know that.\" Much of the attention during Thursday's news conference focused on Falcao. The Colombia striker hinted he wanted to stay at United beyond his season-long loan from Monaco, with the Old Trafford club having an option to buy him for \u00a344m (55m euros) in the summer. \"This is a new process, a new team,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I would like to be here and part of his project. Every player wants to play Champions League. \"This year it is not possible in Manchester, but we are confident to achieve the qualification for the next season.\" Van Gaal praised Falcao, adding he believed he could lift United to new heights. \"When you see his record, it is unbelievable,\" he said. \"Today in the training session, he got one ball and it was in the goal. \"When I say this I put too much pressure on him, I know it is very difficult to come from another club to Manchester United in a new process.\"", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal says striker Danny Welbeck was sold because he did not score enough goals.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Male\nTask 3 output: The given context is too vague to determine if it is appropriate or makes sense.

The company is facing some 11,700 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products. Leavitt\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Satterley, accused J&J in his opening statement of knowingly selling a dangerous product, according to an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. \u201cThe evidence will show that J&J knew about the asbestos risk and they continued to sell the product, giving consumers no opportunity to protect themselves,\u201d he said. A lawyer for co-defendant Imerys Talc America, a unit of French Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), told the jury the evidence would show there is no asbestos in its talc and that Leavitt\u2019s disease was not caused by its product. A lawyer for J&J will make his opening remarks on Tuesday. \u201cOur talc is safe and does not contain asbestos. For decades, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder has repeatedly been tested and been found not to contain asbestos,\u201d the company said in response to a request for comment on Monday. J&J and Imerys have argued in court that decades of studies have shown their products to be safe and asbestos-free. Leavitt\u2019s is the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing internal J&J documents showing talc in the company\u2019s raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. The report prompted a stock selloff on fears of J&J\u2019s liability. Shares on Monday closed at $127.01, 14 percent below their Dec. 13 value. While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Leavitt\u2019s case is being tried by the same team of lawyers, including Satterley, who in April 2018 won a $117 million award by a New Jersey jury for a man who blamed his mesothelioma on J&J\u2019s cosmetic talc. That verdict is under appeal. In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal. Leavitt was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. She was born in the Philippines and claims she was exposed to J&J cosmetic talc that originated from South Korea mines during the first two years of her life before her parents moved back to the United States in 1968, Satterley said on Monday. He said testing of Asian talc samples from the 1960s and 1970s by his own expert would show Korean-mined talc tested positive for asbestos fibers, as has talc from U.S. sources. J&J in court filings in the Leavitt case said that fibers found in the Korean talc or any of its other cosmetic talc could not be classified as asbestos and referred to them as non-asbestos forms that its experts say are harmless.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand M\u0101ori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the name of the person who rarely worked with Heseltine, although they had much in common?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Who is the individual who seldom collaborated with Heseltine, despite sharing many similarities?\nTask 3 output: The individual who seldom collaborated with Heseltine, despite sharing many similarities is Margaret Thatcher."}, {"instruction": "Generate a question given a passage that mentions people, places, or things. and then Answer questions about the same entity in the paragraph.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920\u201321 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death.

His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon.

Speaking as he presented his two latest signings, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind, Van Gaal explained why Welbeck, 23, was sold to Arsenal for \u00a316m. \"He played three seasons for the first team, but he doesn't have the record of Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney. And that is the standard,\" Van Gaal said. \"That is why we let him go, because of Falcao, but also to allow the youngsters to fit in. That is the policy. That is why I am here.\" Welbeck joined Arsenal on transfer deadline day in a deal Gunners manager Arsene Wenger revealed almost did not happen. The Manchester-born forward, who scored both goals for England in Monday's 2-0 victory over Switzerland, netted 29 times in 142 United appearances. Welbeck's international team-mate Rooney, 28, has scored 217 goals for United in 445 matches, while Dutchman van Persie, 31, has hit 48 in 78 games. United spent close to \u00a3150m during a summer transfer spree, but also allowed a large number of players to leave. Van Gaal said promoting local young players was a cornerstone of his philosophy at Old Trafford. \"We let 14 players go, we have only brought six players in,\" he added. \"That means there are many positions vacant, they are vacant for the youth. \"I have already used a lot of youngsters in the season and pre-season, so I am always willing to give young players chances - but they have to take the chances. \"The possibility is there. All the youngsters have to know that.\" Much of the attention during Thursday's news conference focused on Falcao. The Colombia striker hinted he wanted to stay at United beyond his season-long loan from Monaco, with the Old Trafford club having an option to buy him for \u00a344m (55m euros) in the summer. \"This is a new process, a new team,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I would like to be here and part of his project.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members.

He says they signal a \u00a33.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and \u00a31bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around \u00a311bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of four point two billion pounds in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 3 output: The words in the input stream are grammatically correct."}, {"instruction": "Complete the story by predicting the appropriate last sentence. and then Generate a story based on the given negative review. and then Determine if the story is ironic or not based on the given definition of irony.", "input": "Sentence1: Jim found an old disposable camera in the bottom of his junk drawer.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416\u2013359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359\u2013299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920\u201321 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Targeting A20 Decreases Glioma Stem Cell Survival and Tumor Growth\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Subject: Targeting A20, Predicate: Decreases, Object: Glioma Stem Cell Survival; Subject: Targeting A20, Predicate: Decreases, Object: Tumor Growth\nTask 3 output: Targeting A20 decreases glioma stem cell survival and tumor growth."}, {"instruction": "Correct the grammar errors in the given sentence. and then Write a compressed version of the given description in one sentence. and then Generate a summary of the conversation that covers the complete context of the compressed description.", "input": "['to', 'change', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'sound', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'properties', 'of', 'the', 'medium', 'that', 'that', 'sound', 'wave', 'is', 'traveling', 'through', 'and', \"there's\", 'two', 'main', 'factors', 'about', 'a', 'medium', 'that', 'will', 'determine', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'the', 'sound', 'wave', 'through', 'that', 'medium', 'one', 'is', 'the', 'stiffness', 'of', 'the', 'medium', 'or', 'how', 'rigid', 'it', 'is', 'the', 'stiffer', 'the', 'medium', 'the', 'faster', 'the', 'sound', 'waves', 'will', 'travel', 'through', 'it', 'this', 'is', 'because', 'in', 'a', 'stiff', 'material', 'each', 'molecule', 'is', 'more', 'interconnected', 'to', 'the', 'other', 'molecules', 'around', 'it', 'so', 'any', 'disturbance', 'gets', 'transmitted', 'faster', 'down', 'the', 'line', 'the', 'other', 'factor', 'that', 'determines', 'the']", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: ['to', 'change', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'sound', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'properties', 'of', 'the', 'medium', 'that', 'that', 'sound', 'wave', 'is', 'traveling', 'through', 'and', \"there's\", 'two', 'main', 'factors', 'about', 'a', 'medium', 'that', 'will', 'determine', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'the', 'sound', 'wave', 'through', 'that', 'medium.', 'One', 'is', 'the', 'stiffness', 'of', 'the', 'medium', 'or', 'how', 'rigid', 'it', 'is.', 'The', 'stiffer', 'the', 'medium', 'the', 'faster', 'the', 'sound', 'waves', 'will', 'travel', 'through', 'it.', 'This', 'is', 'because', 'in', 'a', 'stiff', 'material,', 'each', 'molecule', 'is', 'more', 'interconnected', 'to', 'the', 'other', 'molecules', 'around', 'it.', 'So', 'any', 'disturbance', 'gets', 'transmitted', 'faster', 'down', 'the', 'line.', 'The', 'other', 'factor', 'that', 'determines', 'the']\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: speed of the sound wave through that medium is the density of the medium.

I picked it up and ran down the street. On my front porch, I found a monster who really gave me the creeps. He began to chase me and I ran into the house. Then he came in and slept on the couch. I woke up the next morning to see if he was still there, only to find out it was all a dream and I didn't really care.\nTask 3 output: On one dark and stormy Friday night, as the clock struck midnight, I cautiously stepped out of my cozy home into the eerie silence that enveloped the neighborhood. The ominous clouds loomed overhead, casting an eerie glow on the deserted streets. Suddenly, a deafening clap of thunder echoed through the air, causing my heart to skip a beat. The heavens opened up, unleashing a torrential downpour that soaked me to the bone within seconds. Determined to seek shelter, I hurriedly made my way down Mulberry Street, the raindrops pelting against my face like icy needles. As I reached my front door, I fumbled with the key, my trembling hands struggling to find the right fit. The towering trees lining the street swayed menacingly in the gusty wind, their branches creaking and groaning in protest. The rustling of leaves underfoot added to the eerie atmosphere, sending shivers down my spine. Fear gripped me as I realized I was locked out of my own home, vulnerable to the elements and the unknown lurking in the darkness. Desperate for refuge, I sprinted back up the road to my neighbor's house, praying they would be home. Relief washed over me as I spotted my father through the window, his worried face illuminated by the soft glow of candlelight. He rushed to my aid, handing me the spare key with a reassuring smile. But as fate would have it, my trembling fingers betrayed me, and the key slipped from my grasp, clattering onto the cold, wet pavement. Panic surged through my veins as I frantically retrieved the key, my heart pounding in my chest. With renewed determination, I resumed my sprint down the rain-soaked street, the sound of my own ragged breaths drowned out by the relentless downpour. Finally, I reached the sanctuary of my front porch, my drenched clothes clinging to my shivering body. But to my horror, a monstrous figure awaited me, its grotesque features illuminated by the flickering porch light. Fear paralyzed me as the creature began to chase me, its heavy footsteps echoing in my ears. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I darted into the safety of my home, slamming the door shut behind me. To my disbelief, the creature followed, barging into my sanctuary and making itself at home on the couch. Exhausted and terrified, I retreated to my room, praying for morning to come and banish this nightmare. As the first rays of sunlight filtered through my window, I cautiously ventured out, half-expecting to find the monster still lurking in the shadows. But to my immense relief, it was all just a dream, a figment of my imagination that held no power over me. With a newfound sense of calm, I shrugged off the lingering unease and embraced the day ahead, grateful for the mundane reality that awaited me."}, {"instruction": "Extract RDF triplets from the given sentence. and then Correct the grammar errors in the related fact. and then Classify the corrected fact as either spam or ham based on its content.", "input": "\"forced entry\" had 14.59 million U.S. viewers.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: [['forced entry', 'U.S._VIEWERS_(MILLIONS)', '14.59']]\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The duration of the event was 14.59 U.S. viewers (millions), which is an implausible answer.\nTask 3 output: \u0a07\u0a35\u0a48\u0a02\u0a1f \u0a26\u0a40 \u0a2e\u0a41\u0a26\u0a24 14.59 \u0a2f\u0a42.\u0a10\u0a38. \u0a35\u0a3f\u0a0a\u0a05\u0a30 (\u0a2e\u0a3f\u0a32\u0a40\u0a05\u0a28) \u0a38\u0a40, \u0a1c\u0a4b \u0a07\u0a71\u0a15 \u0a05\u0a38\u0a25\u0a3e\u0a28\u0a15 \u0a1c\u0a35\u0a3e\u0a2c \u0a39\u0a48\u0964"}, {"instruction": "Extract RDF triplets from the given sentence. and then Fix the SQL query based on feedback from the RDF triplets. and then Simplify each sentence in the fixed SQL query to make it easier for non-native English speakers to understand.", "input": "The Rice Boat is found in the area of city centre and offers Fast food.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand M\u0101ori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: What is the name of the person who rarely worked with Heseltine, although they had much in common?\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Who is the individual who seldom collaborated with Heseltine, despite sharing many similarities?\nTask 3 output: \u0a15\u0a4c\u0a23 \u0a39\u0a48 \u0a09\u0a39 \u0a35\u0a3f\u0a05\u0a15\u0a24\u0a40 \u0a1c\u0a4b \u0a39\u0a47\u0a38\u0a32\u0a1f\u0a3e\u0a08\u0a28 \u0a28\u0a3e\u0a32 \u0a2c\u0a39\u0a41\u0a24 \u0a38\u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a28\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a38\u0a3e\u0a02\u0a1d\u0a40 \u0a15\u0a30\u0a26\u0a3e \u0a39\u0a48, \u0a2a\u0a30 \u0a2c\u0a39\u0a41\u0a24 \u0a15\u0a2e \u0a38\u0a2e\u0a47\u0a02 \u0a32\u0a08 \u0a38\u0a39\u0a3f\u0a2f\u0a4b\u0a17 \u0a15\u0a30\u0a26\u0a3e \u0a39\u0a48?"}, {"instruction": "Convert text numbers in a passage into digit form. and then Correct the grammar errors in the given digit form numbers. and then Identify the word with a typo in the corrected digit form numbers.", "input": "After his death in the fourteen eighties, or at least by fourteen ninety, printing in Venice had declined very much;", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: After his death in the 1480s, or at least by 1490, printing in Venice had declined very much;\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: After his death in the 1480s, or at least by 1490, printing in Venice had declined significantly.\nTask 3 output: 1480s"}, {"instruction": "Fix an SQL query based on feedback. and then Generate a question that mentions people, places, or things given the fixed SQL query. and then Classify the question into one of the following categories: Background, Purpose, Method, or Finding.", "input": "SQL: SELECT title FROM film WHERE title LIKE \"Deleted Scenes\" Feedback: It should be special features contains Deleted Scenes\" instead of \"title contains Deleted Scenes\".", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: SELECT title FROM film WHERE special_features LIKE '%Deleted Scenes%'\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: What type of scenes are included in the films with the special feature 'Deleted Scenes'?\nTask 3 output: Purpose"}, {"instruction": "Generate a natural language interpretation of a given command involving logical operations on a table. and then Follow the natural language interpretation and perform basic logic and conditionals. and then Identify the word with a typo in the result of logic and conditionals.", "input": "eq { hop { nth_argmax { all_rows ; length ( male ) ; 3 } ; scientific name } ; trioceros jacksonii } = true", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: select the row whose length  male  record of all rows is 3rd maximum . the scientific name record of this row is trioceros jacksonii .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: The row with the 3rd maximum length of male records is selected.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Simplifying the sentence: Using a statistical model, we analyzed the performance of influenza surveillance systems in Hong Kong based on the collected data.\nTask 3 output: True"}, {"instruction": "Identify the element that the marked number refers to in the given text. and then Elaborate the given question by providing more details, using specific language, and adding additional information without changing the overall meaning. and then Provide a justification for the coreference between a pronoun and a noun phrase in the given sentence.

The story mentioned risk of bleeding at the site of catheter insertion as a possible harm of treatment which was greater for those who had a the catheter inserted in the leg.

The story did not mention whether there were any particular side effects or harms associated with catheter insertion at the wrist. The story explained that the study was an analysis of information contained within a national registry.

Thus the statement in the story \u2018both methods were equally effective\u2019 should have been more tentative. The underlying weakness of the study, that it is not a controlled trial, may mean that the patients who had the wrist approach had something else about them that helped to reduce risk and that the researchers may not have been able to take into consideration. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included interview material from one clinician who was not associated with the study reported on.

Least square methods make the best use of available data directly computing the TD solution and thus do not require tuning a typically highly sensitive learning rate parameter, but require quadratic computation and storage. Recent algorithmic developments have yielded several sub-quadratic methods that use an approximation to the least squares TD solution, but incur bias. In this paper, we propose a new family of accelerated gradient TD (ATD) methods that (1) provide similar data efficiency benefits to least-squares methods, at a fraction of the computation and storage (2) significantly reduce parameter sensitivity compared to linear TD methods, and (3) are asymptotically unbiased.

Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. In summary, our studies suggest that GW3965 inhibits NDV infection, probably by affecting cholesterol homeostasis.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: The LXR ligand GW3965 inhibits Newcastle disease virus infection by affecting cholesterol homeostasis\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: In a research laboratory, scientists were studying the effects of different compounds on viral infections.

They became interested in GW3965, a specific compound that displayed positive outcomes in preventing the spread of Newcastle disease virus.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416\u2013359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359\u2013299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \"Conrack\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \"what death would sound like\".  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \"the river.\"  As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.  As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its Os\u00e9 robotic \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d It\u2019s one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad \u201cbooth babes,\u201d fostering a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official \u201cequality partner,\u201d The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. It\u2019s been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startups\u2019 female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Crave\u2019s exhibit included a camper with a \u201cBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,\u201d where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other \u201cfem tech\u201d companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. \u201cLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,\u201d said Barrica, who recently published the book \u201cSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.\u201d Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,\u201d she said. Founders insist that their devices \u2014 ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories \u2014 have effects outside the bedroom. \u201cSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,\u201d said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. \u201cIt does way more than just pleasure. It\u2019s immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.\u201d DiCarlo\u2019s $290 Os\u00e9 device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA\u2019s image.\u201d DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new \u201cInnovation for All\u201d sessions with senior diversity officials. Os\u00e9 began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. \u201cThings are better, but there\u2019s just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,\u201d she said.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong

While public health experts are demanding bolder action, most governors and mayors have not imposed mandatory stay-at-home orders. Their apparent reluctance comes amid Bolsonaro\u2019s relentless message for Brazilians to defy regional and local public health efforts to stop the virus\u2019 spread. Stricter lockdowns are needed because Brazilian doctors are now being forced to choose who lives and dies and triage situations could generate social unrest if they increase, said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil\u2019s non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. \u201cWe need to avoid a total disaster,\u201d he said. Lago said mandatory lockdowns across much of the country would help: \u201cIt is late in terms of avoiding hospital collapse, but certainly it isn\u2019t too late to avoid a bigger catastrophe.\u201d Brazil had more than 177,000 confirmed cases on Tuesday, with the actual figure believed to be much higher because of limited testing. Many intensive care hospital units are full and cemeteries are increasingly overwhelmed with bodies. Bolsonaro, who called the virus a \u201clittle flu,\u201d has insisted for more than a month that governors are stoking economic carnage with voluntary quarantine recommendations and urges Brazilians to go about their everyday. He reiterated criticism of governors Tuesday for ignoring his decree that gyms, barbershops and beauty salons should be treated as essential services. Amid Bolsonaro\u2019s rejection of coronavirus danger, most of the country\u2019s 27 governors have criticized his stances but none have imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, the governors have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or deferred to mayors to make those decisions. Governors had been hoping the virus would not spread in Brazil\u2019s warm climate, but their response is also a reflection of Brazil\u2019s political landscape because the governors depend on mayors to endorse re-election campaigns. Many worry that imposing mandatory lockdowns could hurt local leaders in this year\u2019s municipal election, decreasing support for incumbent governors in their 2022 campaigns, said Thiago de Arag\u00e3o, director of strategy of the Arko Advice political consultancy. But as the death toll rose from less than 7,000 to more than 10,000 last week, local authorities began adopting stricter anti-virus measures. The riverside community of Tefe in the Amazon region was among the first, with a lockdown decree specifying criminal charges for residents leaving home except for visits to hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets. The mayor imposed it because only about half of Tefe\u2019s 60,000 residents complied with an earlier recommendation by the governor of Amazonas state to take virus precautions. Those who did not comply \u201cthink they\u2019re immortal, that they won\u2019t get it,\u201d Tefe Mayor Normando Bessa de S\u00e1 said on Facebook. Over the next three days, the governors of the northern and northeastern states of Maranhao, Para and Ceara decreed lockdowns for their capital cities as intensive-care units filled with COVID-19 patients. Despite the new lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo still don\u2019t have mandatory stay-at-home-orders at the state or city level \u2014 even though they are the hardest hit places in Brazil. Lockdowns \u201cshould have been imposed at least three weeks ago, when the epidemic was already increasing, but not at this speed that it is now,\u201d said Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory physician and researcher with the widely respected Oswaldo Cruz Foundation biological research group. \u201cI gave that recommendation more than once,\u201d said Dalcolmo, among the experts on a COVID-19 panel that advises Rio\u2019s governor. Rio Gov. Wilson Witzel has decreed non-binding quarantine recommendations and commerce restrictions through the end of May. He pledged to make police available so the state\u2019s 92 mayors can enact lockdowns, instead of imposing them himself. In another example of Brazil\u2019s scattershot local lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella on Monday prohibited non-residents from entering 11 neighborhoods and ordered the closure of all businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies in the teeming slums called favelas. \u201cPeople still haven\u2019t perceived the need to avoid gatherings, stay home,\u201d Crivella complained. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems. The cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo near Rio on Monday authorized fines and criminal charges for violating stay-at-home orders. Niteroi police took the temperatures of those entering the city, and put a man and his two dogs inside a police van after he allegedly refused to show documents to justify being out of his home. In Sao Paulo state, Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria last month urged but did not require residents to self-quarantine while shutting down schools and most businesses. Nearly 70% of the state\u2019s 44 million people initially complied, but that dropped below 50% in recent weeks, according to cellphone carrier data provided by the state. Doria, a presidential hopeful, saw his popularity increase as he challenged Bolsonaro. But police stopped enforcing his recommendations after Bolsonaro criticized the handcuffing and detention of a middle-aged woman exercising in a park who resisted removal. With noncompliance rising, Doria said last week that \u201cif we need to step up to a lockdown, we will not hesitate.\u201d Sao Paulo\u2019s mayor this week limited vehicles circulating in the city to 50% of the normal flow. Television images showed long lines of people entering crammed buses with standing room only in clear violation of social distancing guidelines. Public health analysts from the Imperial College London, whose COVID-19 research has guided global policymakers, last week called Brazil\u2019s anti-virus efforts \u201cpartially successful.\u201d \u201cIn the absence of the introduction of further control measures that will more strongly curb transmission, Brazil faces the prospect of an epidemic that will continue to grow exponentially,\u201d they wrote. ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Brazil cities lurch to lockdowns amid virus crisis red flags.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: As the COVID-19 crisis continues to escalate in Brazil, cities across the country are implementing strict lockdown measures.

Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Subject: Influenza surveillance systems performance, Predicate: Characterizing, Object: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 3 output: No"}, {"instruction": "Correct the grammar errors in the given sentence. and then Write a compressed version of the corrected sentence in one sentence. and then Identify the connecting word between the compressed sentence and the given sentences.", "input": "['what', 'I', 'hope', 'to', 'do', 'in', 'this', 'video', 'is', 'give', 'ourselves', 'some', 'practice', 'interpreting', 'statements', 'and', 'writing', 'them', 'as', 'mathematical', 'expressions', 'possibly', 'using', 'parentheses', 'so', \"let's\", 'get', 'started', 'and', 'for', 'any', 'of', 'these', 'statements', 'if', 'you', 'get', 'so', 'inspired', 'and', '', 'encourage', 'you', 'to', 'get', 'so', 'inspired', 'pause', 'the', 'video', 'and', 'see', 'if', 'you', 'can', 'write', 'them', 'as', 'mathematical', 'expressions', 'so', 'this', 'first', 'one', 'says', 'seven', 'hundred', 'minus', '19', 'divided', 'in', 'half', 'so', 'we', 'could', 'say', 'we', 'another', 'way', 'to', 'think', 'about', 'divided', 'in', 'half', 'is', 'divided', 'by', 'two', 'so', 'we', 'could', 'write', 'this', 'as', 'seven', 'hundred', 'and', 'nine', 'minus']", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: ['what', 'I', 'hope', 'to', 'do', 'in', 'this', 'video,', 'is', 'give', 'ourselves', 'some', 'practice', 'interpreting', 'statements', 'and', 'writing', 'them', 'as', 'mathematical', 'expressions,', 'possibly', 'using', 'parentheses.', 'So', \"let's\", 'get', 'started.', 'And', 'for', 'any', 'of', 'these', 'statements,', 'if', 'you', 'get', 'so', 'inspired,', 'and', '', 'encourage', 'you', 'to', 'get', 'so', 'inspired,', 'pause', 'the', 'video', 'and', 'see', 'if', 'you', 'can', 'write', 'them', 'as', 'mathematical', 'expressions.', 'So', 'this', 'first', 'one', 'says', 'seven', 'hundred', 'minus', '19,', 'divided', 'in', 'half.', 'So', 'we', 'could', 'say', 'we', 'another', 'way', 'to', 'think', 'about', 'divided', 'in', 'half', 'is', 'divided', 'by', 'two,', 'so', 'we', 'could', 'write', 'this', 'as', 'seven', 'hundred', 'and', 'nine', 'minus']\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: In this video, we will practice interpreting statements and writing them as mathematical expressions, possibly using parentheses.

We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia.

METHODS AND RESULTS In 30 obese subjects (age 42\u00b111 years, body mass index 46\u00b111 kg/m(2)) undergoing bariatric surgery, we intraoperatively collected visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and characterized depot-specific adipose phenotypes. We assessed vasomotor function of the adipose microvasculature using videomicroscopy of small arterioles (75-250 \u03bcm) isolated from different fat compartments. Endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation was severely impaired in visceral arterioles, compared to the subcutaneous depot (P<0.001 by ANOVA). Nonendothelium dependent responses to papaverine and nitroprusside were similar. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester reduced subcutaneous vasodilation but had no effect on severely blunted visceral arteriolar responses. Visceral fat exhibited greater expression of proinflammatory, oxidative stress-related, hypoxia-induced, and proangiogenic genes; increased activated macrophage populations; and had a higher capacity for cytokine production ex vivo.     CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide clinical evidence that the visceral microenvironment may be intrinsically toxic to arterial health providing a potential mechanism by which visceral adiposity burden is linked to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Our findings also support the evolving concept that both adipose tissue quality and quantity may play significant roles in shaping cardiovascular phenotypes in human obesity.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Arteriolar function in visceral adipose tissue is impaired in human obesity.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Arteriolar function in visceral adipose tissue is impaired in humans with obesity.\nTask 3 output: The artist used bold and vibrant colors to arteriolar the canvas, creating a visually stunning masterpiece."}, {"instruction": "Create a pair of sentences that clearly contradict each other.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Simplifying the sentence: Using a statistical model, we analyzed the performance of influenza surveillance systems in Hong Kong based on the collected data.\nTask 3 output: 11"}, {"instruction": "Generate a natural language interpretation of a given command involving logical operations on a table. and then Transform the negative review into a positive review with minimal changes. and then Translate the positive review to Panjabi without omitting or adding any information.", "input": "and { only { filter_eq { all_rows ; nationality ; jamaica } } ; eq { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; nationality ; jamaica } ; athlete } ; michael blackwood } } = true", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: select the rows whose nationality record fuzzily matches to jamaica . there is only one such row in the table . the athlete record of this unqiue row is michael blackwood .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: select the rows whose nationality record fuzzily matches to not jamaica . there is only one such row in the table . the athlete record of this unqiue row is michael blackwood .\nTask 3 output: No"}, {"instruction": "Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, flipping the answer from PersonX to PersonY.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its Os\u00e9 robotic \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d It\u2019s one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad \u201cbooth babes,\u201d fostering a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official \u201cequality partner,\u201d The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. It\u2019s been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startups\u2019 female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Crave\u2019s exhibit included a camper with a \u201cBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,\u201d where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other \u201cfem tech\u201d companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. \u201cLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,\u201d said Barrica, who recently published the book \u201cSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.\u201d Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,\u201d she said. Founders insist that their devices \u2014 ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories \u2014 have effects outside the bedroom. \u201cSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,\u201d said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. \u201cIt does way more than just pleasure. It\u2019s immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.\u201d DiCarlo\u2019s $290 Os\u00e9 device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA\u2019s image.\u201d DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new \u201cInnovation for All\u201d sessions with senior diversity officials. Os\u00e9 began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. \u201cThings are better, but there\u2019s just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,\u201d she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ AP\u2019s CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech is gracing the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week, a year after organizers took fire for revoking an innovation award to a sex device company led by a female founder.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Sex tech is being showcased at CES in Las Vegas, a year after controversy over a revoked innovation award to a female-led sex device company.\nTask 3 output: At CES in Las Vegas, sex technology is being exhibited, following a previous controversy involving the withdrawal of an innovation award from a company that produces sex devices led by women."}, {"instruction": "Elaborate the given sentence by providing more details, using specific language, and adding additional information without changing the overall meaning. and then Generate a story based on the elaborated sentence. and then Classify the discourse type of the two given sentences in the story.", "input": "The Zugangserschwerungsgesetz was a German law which aimed to make the access to child pornography over the internet more difficult .", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: The Zugangserschwerungsgesetz ( Access Impediment Act , or ZugErschwG ) was a German law that aimed to make it difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with depictions of sexual activity by and against children ( child pornography ) .\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: In a small town in Germany, there was a law called the Zugangserschwerungsgesetz, also known as the Access Impediment Act.

In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down.

While Underwood is no fan of President Donald Trump, she said her No. 1 concern \u2014 and the top concern of the voters she hopes to will send her to Washington \u2014 is access to health care. Attacking the Republican president hard just isn\u2019t necessarily a winning play in Illinois\u2019 14th congressional district, said Underwood, who served as an adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services under Democratic President Barack Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about him that much. He has a higher approval rating than my congressman does, so we talk about our congressman,\u201d said Underwood, who\u2019s hoping to oust incumbent Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren in a district that narrowly backed Trump two years ago. Other Democrats aiming to flip House seats say they\u2019re also trying to zero in on policy more than the president. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has its hopes pinned on 50-plus candidates looking to upend enough seats \u2014 23 \u2014 to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP for the first time in eight years. Republicans have their own plan to retain control, but Democrats are banking they have more than just both momentum and history on their side. U.S. Rep. Denny Heck is helping lead the effort to flip the House. The Washington Democrat said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee can assist candidates with a range of tasks \u2014 from tapping into a national donor base to aiding with the basic mechanics of building a campaign. But he warned that trash-talking Trump will get a candidate only so far. \u201cWhat candidates ought to be doing is talking about that crowded freeway that they need to get additional funds to widen or additional funds to provide mass transit for, or that lake that is becoming polluted and they need the EPA to step up,\u201d Heck said. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is also on the \u201cRed to Blue\u201d list. Mucarsel-Powell, who came from Ecuador as an immigrant with her mother, said Florida\u2019s 26th Congressional District \u2014 the state\u2019s southernmost district \u2014 is one of the most vulnerable for Republicans in the country. She pointed to a 16-point win by Hillary Clinton there in 2016. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo. While Mucarsel-Powell doesn\u2019t shy away from talking about Trump, she says she\u2019s more focused on the struggles of local residents. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to health care. They don\u2019t have good quality education,\u201d she said, adding that tens of thousands depend on the Obama 2010 health care law that Republicans have worked to undo. Talk of a Democratic blue wave is overblown, according to Matt Gorman, communication director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said the committee \u2014 which has its own \u201cYoung Guns\u201d program \u2014 is raising impressive sums and has battle-tested incumbents who know they\u2019re going to be targets. Gorman said the NRCC is also urging candidates to run on local issues and not focus on the latest headlines on cable new or Twitter. He said polling shows the party is in better shape than many assume. \u201cThis is going to be a fight and certainly we\u2019re going to work like we\u2019re 10 points down as we do every day, but for the bedwetters out there who are claiming that all hope is loss I would encourage them to actually look at the data,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple math.\u201d Democratic Rep. Katherine Clark, who is also heading up the DCCC\u2019s \u201cRed to Blue\u201d initiative, said many candidates she\u2019s been working with are more eager to dig into what\u2019s on the minds of voters than taking swipes at Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned with talking about Donald Trump as much as they are about talking about how people in their communities want their children to have job opportunities in the communities that they grew up in,\u201d Clark said. While defeating Trump may galvanize the Democratic faithful, the party is still fumbling for a wider unifying message, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor and former political media consultant. And Democrats may have trouble finding issues, local or not, for voters to latch onto in November. \u201cThe problem is that unemployment is low, economic confidence is relatively high, so to tell people you\u2019ve never had it so bad when compared to eight years ago they\u2019ve got it pretty good, that\u2019s sort of also a tough road to hoe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats may have history on the side. The question is A, will they blow it? And B, is Trump such an anomaly that history is being rewritten?\u201d Roxane Pirayesh, a 32-year-old from Sacramento, California, who works for an education nonprofit, said in the end, the pitch from Democrats has to be more than just an anti-Trump drumbeat \u2014 and she\u2019s not sure everyone\u2019s gotten the message. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably the biggest flaw coming out of the Democratic Party,\u201d she said.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump\\nThey work hard and campaign with a thump\\nTheir goal is clear, to bring change and reform\\nWith determination, they weather any storm\\nUnited they stand, ready to fight\\nFor a better future, with all their might\nTask 3 output: Political"}, {"instruction": "Decompose a yes/no question into a series of sub-questions that can be answered using Wikipedia articles.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920\u201321 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

There was no discussion in the story about whether there are different costs associated with the procedure itself. The story explained that the through-the-wrist approach was associated with lower risk of bleeding and shorter hospitalizations but should have included a caveat explanation about the strength of research and that the results of the study reported on require follow-up investigation. The story mentioned risk of bleeding at the site of catheter insertion as a possible harm of treatment which was greater for those who had a the catheter inserted in the leg. To its credit, the story provided absolute risk information, i.e. pointing out the 60% reduction in bleeding was the difference between 2 and 1% of patients having this complication. The story did not mention whether there were any particular side effects or harms associated with catheter insertion at the wrist. The story explained that the study was an analysis of information contained within a national registry.

Thus the statement in the story \u2018both methods were equally effective\u2019 should have been more tentative. The underlying weakness of the study, that it is not a controlled trial, may mean that the patients who had the wrist approach had something else about them that helped to reduce risk and that the researchers may not have been able to take into consideration. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included interview material from one clinician who was not associated with the study reported on. The quality of the piece would have been improved if it had included input from physicians who might have explained some of the reasons why not all interventional cardiologists use the wrist approach. The story did an adequate job of reporting about a recent study comparing two approaches to angioplasty.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its Os\u00e9 robotic \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d It\u2019s one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad \u201cbooth babes,\u201d fostering a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official \u201cequality partner,\u201d The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. It\u2019s been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startups\u2019 female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Crave\u2019s exhibit included a camper with a \u201cBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,\u201d where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other \u201cfem tech\u201d companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. \u201cLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,\u201d said Barrica, who recently published the book \u201cSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.\u201d Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,\u201d she said. Founders insist that their devices \u2014 ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories \u2014 have effects outside the bedroom. \u201cSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,\u201d said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. \u201cIt does way more than just pleasure. It\u2019s immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.\u201d DiCarlo\u2019s $290 Os\u00e9 device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA\u2019s image.\u201d DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new \u201cInnovation for All\u201d sessions with senior diversity officials. Os\u00e9 began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. \u201cThings are better, but there\u2019s just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,\u201d she said.

In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon.

He says they signal a \u00a33.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and \u00a31bn from research in next week's Spending Review. The government said it could not comment. This is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans. Currently universities are given around \u00a311bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure. The UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities. In his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week. This is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says. He continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of \u00a3700m; the current sum is \u00a33.9bn. \"This implies a cut of around \u00a33.2bn in state funding.\" This would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant. He adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\" A \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government. Professor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\". And he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says. But he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees. He adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\" Responding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth. \"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\" She called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\". President of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission. \"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\" He accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation He added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay. \"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\" But Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education. \"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students. \"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of \u00a34.2bn in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Universities in England face funding cuts of four point two billion pounds in the coming Spending Review, an e-mail leaked to the BBC News website suggests.\nTask 3 output: The given text is plausible as it is common for universities to face funding cuts during a spending review."}, {"instruction": "Decompose a yes/no question into a series of sub-questions that can be answered using Wikipedia articles.

Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was applied to Hong Kong surveillance data to characterize the performance of influenza surveillance systems.\nTask 3 output: True"}, {"instruction": "Write a short description in natural language for given triples that show the relationship between the elements. and then Extract RDF triplets from the given description. and then Determine the topic of the RDF triplets.", "input": "Arrabbiata_sauce | ingredient | Tomato", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Tomato is an ingredient in Arrabbiata sauce.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Triplets: (Tomato, is an ingredient in, Arrabbiata sauce)\nTask 3 output: Tomato"}, {"instruction": "Write a compressed version of the given text in one sentence. and then Generate a story based on the compressed version of the text. and then Simplify the story by using simpler words and sentence structures while maintaining the same meaning.", "input": "In helping children grasp the storytelling script (and in other ways we will take up next), make-believe play is wonderful preparation for literacy.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its Os\u00e9 robotic \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d It\u2019s one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad \u201cbooth babes,\u201d fostering a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official \u201cequality partner,\u201d The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. It\u2019s been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startups\u2019 female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Crave\u2019s exhibit included a camper with a \u201cBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,\u201d where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other \u201cfem tech\u201d companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. \u201cLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,\u201d said Barrica, who recently published the book \u201cSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.\u201d Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,\u201d she said. Founders insist that their devices \u2014 ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories \u2014 have effects outside the bedroom. \u201cSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,\u201d said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. \u201cIt does way more than just pleasure. It\u2019s immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.\u201d DiCarlo\u2019s $290 Os\u00e9 device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA\u2019s image.\u201d DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new \u201cInnovation for All\u201d sessions with senior diversity officials. Os\u00e9 began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. \u201cThings are better, but there\u2019s just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,\u201d she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ AP\u2019s CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: At the CES gadget show, there was a surprising and exciting display of sex tech products from women-led startups.

Gorman said the NRCC is also urging candidates to run on local issues and not focus on the latest headlines on cable new or Twitter. He said polling shows the party is in better shape than many assume. \u201cThis is going to be a fight and certainly we\u2019re going to work like we\u2019re 10 points down as we do every day, but for the bedwetters out there who are claiming that all hope is loss I would encourage them to actually look at the data,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple math.\u201d Democratic Rep. Katherine Clark, who is also heading up the DCCC\u2019s \u201cRed to Blue\u201d initiative, said many candidates she\u2019s been working with are more eager to dig into what\u2019s on the minds of voters than taking swipes at Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned with talking about Donald Trump as much as they are about talking about how people in their communities want their children to have job opportunities in the communities that they grew up in,\u201d Clark said. While defeating Trump may galvanize the Democratic faithful, the party is still fumbling for a wider unifying message, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor and former political media consultant. And Democrats may have trouble finding issues, local or not, for voters to latch onto in November. \u201cThe problem is that unemployment is low, economic confidence is relatively high, so to tell people you\u2019ve never had it so bad when compared to eight years ago they\u2019ve got it pretty good, that\u2019s sort of also a tough road to hoe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats may have history on the side. The question is A, will they blow it? And B, is Trump such an anomaly that history is being rewritten?\u201d Roxane Pirayesh, a 32-year-old from Sacramento, California, who works for an education nonprofit, said in the end, the pitch from Democrats has to be more than just an anti-Trump drumbeat \u2014 and she\u2019s not sure everyone\u2019s gotten the message. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably the biggest flaw coming out of the Democratic Party,\u201d she said.", "output": "Task 1 output and task 2 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump.\nTask 2 output and task 3 input: Democrats hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump\\nThey work hard and campaign with a thump\\nTheir goal is clear, to bring change and reform\\nWith determination, they weather any storm\\nUnited they stand, ready to fight\\nFor a better future, with all their might\nTask 3 output: Republicans hoping to flip House not just trash-talking Trump\\nThey work hard and campaign with a thump\\nTheir goal is clear, to bring change and reform\\nWith determination, they weather any storm\\nUnited they stand, ready to fight\\nFor a better future, with all their might"}, {"instruction": "Rewrite a fill-in-the-blank question by changing the trigger word to its antonym, flipping the answer from PersonX to PersonY.
