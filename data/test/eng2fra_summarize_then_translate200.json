There may be a code against unruly pets or incessant barking at night; many places have legislation or regulations in place that deals specifically with dogs and/or noise. There might also be a code covering ignoring requests from neighbors.   Often neighborhood or civil dispute centers produce small briefs on dog issues, as they're rather commonplace complaints. See if a precedent has already been set in your neighborhood. You may want to share your findings with your neighbor to give him or her one last chance to change before you call the authorities. If you're pretty sure it won't work, move straight to the next step. Find out what town hall/council/municipal office or other relevant authority to call so you can file a report on your neighbors for a noise complaint.The authorities will talk to the dog owner and assess the situation. They will usually inform you of the outcome. If nothing changes, call again a few days later.   You might want to ask if anonymity is an option when you file the report. In some cases, this may not be an issue for you, especially if it's plain-as-day that you're the one pointing the finger thanks to previous attempts. However, if you have various upset neighbors, maintaining anonymity may be useful to prevent retaliation of any sort. Some jurisdictions will act on anonymous complaints, while others require your name and address but won't reveal this to the neighbor complained about. Check the public or private status of making a complaint before making it. If you believe the barking is a result of neglect or another form of abuse, you have the right to call animal control. If the dog is being severely abused it will be confiscated from the owner, but in most cases, animal control won't take the dog away. Instead, they'll come to assess the situation and try to educate the owners as to how to properly care for the dog.   If the dog is left outside during extreme heat or cold, this would be considered a good reason to call animal control. If the dog looks underfed or dehydrated, you can call animal control. If the authorities get multiple calls about the same dog owner, they'll be more likely to take action quickly. There's definitely strength in numbers in this situation, so rally as many people as you can to remedy the situation. Even after getting the authorities involved, some stubborn dog owners won't comply with requests to quiet the dog. If nothing else works, you can sue for nuisance in small claims court. The goal will be to make a case that the dog's barking is preventing you from enjoying your own home. If you win, the dog owner will have to pay a small sum of money. Prepare to sue by doing the following:   Try to negotiate with your neighbor, so you can show the judge that you made an effort. Decide how much you want to sue for.

Don't let yourself spend time being distracted and depressed alone.  Call some friends and plan to do something together, or get some close friends to come over and have a movie night, a dinner party, or play a game of some sort. You may want to take your mind off things, but you may also want to talk out the thing that's bothering you or distracting you. If you're feeling upset over a break-up, a recent disappointment, or some other issue, it might be a good idea to have some sympathetic friends to talk with instead, rather than distract. Whether you live at home or not, whether you have a big family or a small family, whether you are close with your family or not, spending some quality time with your family can help take your mind off other things. Organize plans to do something out with your family, or you could just head to the homestead and spend time at home. Even if you're just eating dinner and watching television, doing it with your family can be more relaxing and comforting than anything else. If your family and friends are busy, consider heading to a public place and just being around people. Even if you don't want to sit somewhere and try to talk to strangers, people watching can be a nice way of keeping your mind off things.  Head to the library, a coffee house, a bar, a local park, or a record store to socialize or people-watch. While it's true that bars can be great neighborhood hangouts and places to socialize over a few drinks, drinking is not recommended as a way to distract your mind, as it can lead to serious problems with alcohol dependency. Go to the bar to socialize, not to drink your trouble away. If you can't have your friends come to you, send something to your friends.

Donation-based yoga classes are available in some areas. Many cities sponsor free art exhibits once or twice a year. Museums may offer free admission every so often. Board games are a great way to have fun while spending as little money as possible. After the initial purchase, it's free entertainment forever! You can have food or drinks at home, play with friends, and have just as much fun as going out on an expensive date.  Try the classic games (Life, Monopoly, Sorry) as well as newer ones (Apples to Apples, Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, etc.).

Both of these medications are available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle. Robaxacet is another option for pain control that also contains a muscle relaxant property. If your back pain is caused from a strained or injured muscle, this is likely to be your best bet to help to alleviate the pain, as well as to speed recovery. If you have sustained a more severe back injury, you may need to opt for stronger pain medications. Interestingly enough, medical trials have shown that getting the pain under control early in a back injury is key to optimal healing. This is because chronic back pain can become a neurological pattern in the central nervous system which makes it more difficult to get rid of the longer you have had it for. Stronger painkillers include prescription strength Naproxen or Tylenol #3 (Tylenol mixed with Codeine), among others. Depending upon the specific type of injury in your back, sometimes an injection (of a corticosteroid medication, normally, which works to fight inflammation and pain) can be of great help. Speak to your doctor if you are interested, or to your naturopath for \"prolotherapy\" (which is the \"natural equivalent\" to a corticosteroid injection). As a last resort for severe back pain, surgeons can either implant a device that stimulates your spinal cord to help diminish pain, or they can perform back surgery if there is an anatomical injury that can be resolved through surgery. Note that both of these are \"last resort\" options that are only considered after you have \"failed\" to improve with lifestyle methods, rest, and medication. More than 50% of people with chronic back pain develop temporary or ongoing depression alongside the back pain, oftentimes related to the disability they face as a result of the injury. If you feel like you may have depression, or be at risk of developing it, speak to your doctor for guidance and medication if needed. Knowing the cause of your back pain can be very helpful to healing it effectively. Some of the most common causes of back pain include:  Poor posture at work, with too much standing or continually sitting in one position. A muscular injury leading to muscle spasms. Degenerative disc disease. A herniated disc. Spinal stenosis - where the vertebral canal (housing your spinal cord) narrows over time.

Measure out the length and width of the trim space on all sides of the door to find out how much trim you need. Narrower trim can be a good choice for simplicity and appearance, but make sure you leave enough material to cover the gap between the door frame and wall.

It’s helpful to practice using the miter saw on scrap wood first. You are usually able to adjust the saw more than you expect to get a better-fitting joint.

This mixture will dissolve corrosion on the battery posts and cable terminals and also help neutralize any acid.  You can also purchase commercial battery cleaners for this purpose. These typically come in the form of a spray-on foam. Look for them in a local auto parts store or in the automotive section of a department store.  Alternatively, you can clean off the corrosion by pouring a small amount of cola over it! When you’ve poured about half the mixture onto the posts, set the rest aside so you can use it to clean the terminals.  If there’s a lot of corrosive buildup, let the mixture sit for at least 5 minutes before you try to scrub it off. Alternatively, you can remove the battery before cleaning it. This will allow you to clean up any corrosion that’s gotten onto other parts of the battery or into the battery box. You can also take this opportunity to inspect your battery for signs of damage, such as cracks or bulges in the casing. Take an old toothbrush or a battery post and terminal brush and scrub the posts to clean off the corrosion. If the corrosion is fairly light, the baking soda solution may do most of the work for you, in which case, you won’t need to do much scrubbing. You can also use a wire brush to clean off the residue. If there’s corrosive buildup on the terminal clamps, pour the remaining baking soda solution over them. Use your toothbrush or a terminal brush to scrub away any residue that remains. Focus on the parts of the terminals that make direct contact with the battery posts.

This way you can tell immediately if the company you're interested in is lowballing the salary offer.  Websites like Glassdoor and Payscale provide salary data for many companies and industries. You can search these websites to find the salary levels of jobs comparable to the one you're interested in.  You can also ask friends and colleagues who work in the same field if they are comfortable sharing their salary information with you. It is important to know both what your ideal target salary is and what your minimum acceptable salary is before learning the starting salary of the job. If the starting salary does not meet this minimum standard, you should probably not continue with the interview process for this particular job.  You might be asked what your target salary is before the starting salary is disclosed, which is another good reason to have your salary range in mind already.  Research will help you to determine your salary range. You can use websites like Glassdoor and Payscale again to get a sense of what professionals with similar experience and education to your own make in your field and city.  Special skills, such as knowledge of specific computer programs, years of experience, and levels of education, for instance having a graduate degree, can make you a desirable candidate and might help you command a higher salary than the average in your field. If the starting salary is not advertised, you do not necessarily have to inquire what it is before deciding whether or not you might like the job. You can go on one interview first if you want. However, don't accept a second interview before determining what the starting salary is. Although it would be helpful if the salary range was listed in the job advertisement, many companies don't disclose it because they are probably hoping to find a candidate who is unaware of their own market worth and the average salary range in the field, whom they can lowball. That's why it's helpful to do your research before asking about salary. When a company recruiter or the hiring manager emails you to ask about your interest in the position or to schedule a second interview if you've already had one, take this opportunity in your reply message to ask what the salary is. If the company never reaches out to you, you can assume they aren't interested in hiring you and so knowing the starting salary is moot. Another advantage to asking about salary in a reply message is that you don't have to think of a subject line of your own for the email. You should always treat emails about work the way you would letters. In your salutation, you should use the name that the person emailing you signed off with in their message, or whatever name they used when they introduced themselves if you've already met in person. Show enthusiasm for the position. If the company has asked whether you're interested in the job, you should thank them for their message, state that the position does sound interesting, and then write \"May I ask what the salary range is?\" If the company is reaching out to schedule a second interview, reply to the person who emailed you that you are excited to come back and ask if they are the right person to speak to about compensation for this job. The company recruiter or hiring manager may ask what salary you're making at your job now rather than answer your inquiry about salary directly. This is another lowballing tactic since they're hopeful that you'll disclose a salary lower than the amount they are willing to pay and they can then offer you this same figure rather than the higher one they might otherwise have given.  It is unethical and in some cases illegal for a company to ask about candidates' confidential information like current salary. This is a privacy violation. The State of Massachusetts made it illegal starting in 2018 for an employer to ask about past earnings. New York City and Philadelphia have passed similar laws.  If a recruiter asks about your current salary, reply by stating the salary range you are focusing on in your job hunt and ask if this position falls in that range.  If the company insists on knowing your current salary, you should probably walk away from the job.

Whenever you act chivalrous, do your best to act subtly, instead of making your romantic gestures obvious. Some girls don’t like acts of chivalry. Make sure you know your crush’s opinion on this before you do anything. Take a chance and ask her if she’d like to grab a meal or see a movie with you. While this can seem like a risky romantic maneuver, you can clearly show your intentions without anything getting lost in translation. Only ask her once, and accept her answer after she gives it to you. If she doesn’t want to go on a date, respect her decision.  Try and come up with a fairly specific plan for your date. The term “hang out” might be too ambiguous for some girls. For example, say something like: “Hey! I was wondering if you’d like to meet up for dinner on Friday. I know a great Italian restaurant in town. Would you be interested?” You can ask her out in-person, online, or over text. Pay attention to the people she hangs out with. While you don’t want to come off as a stalker, you can end up appearing very friendly and genuine by trying to meet and get along with her closest mates. Start with basic conversation when talking to her friends and being as cordial and genuine as possible.  This can be a trickier route to navigate if you do most of your chatting and messaging online. Keep your distance by messaging her friends with a basic and friendly greeting, if you choose to contact them at all. Make it clear that you’re not trying to flirt with her friends, as this could give her the wrong idea. Whenever you talk with her friends, keep your conversations completely casual without any hint of romantic interest. Give the girl your full attention when she talks to you, whether it’s a relaxed or serious topic. If you display an interest in the mundane aspects of her life, you’ll appear to be a genuine, caring person. If you make her feel valued, she might be more interested in pursuing a relationship with you.  Make an effort to be active and engaged whenever she talks to you. For instance, try saying something like: “Hey! How did your chemistry test end up going?” Pay attention to what she likes, such as her food preferences and favorite color. The next time you see her, bring a snack or drink that’s in a flavor she really enjoys. Additionally, try asking for or offering different music recommendations, as this could give you both something fun to talk about. For example, try asking her something like this: “I was listening to the radio the other day and heard a song by this new indie band. Are you into indie music at all?” Make a nice statement her sense of style, or something you like about her personality or work ethic. As you speak, make the compliment as heartfelt as possible, whether it’s about her new haircut or about the kind way she treats others.  For instance, try saying something like: “You’re such a kind and caring person. I really admire how you always put everyone else first.” While physical compliments can be flattering, avoid making any remarks that might seem objectifying.

This is followed by a period of rest. Recreating this scenario by playing with your cat can regulate their energy levels to meet yours. Use interactive toys like wand toys, laser pointers, or hiding toys to hunt to tire your cat out. Be sure to create a play environment that gives your cat room to run, climb, and jump. You should play with your cat at least 15 minutes every day and twice a day if possible. Bored cats can be restless, exhibit inappropriate behaviours, and become aggressive. Exercise or play will help solve some unwanted behaviours, such as not allowing you to sleep at night by being aggressive, meowing throughout the night, or causing a ruckus around the house. You want to keep your cat busy and active during the day so that they don't accumulate pent up energy. There are several ways to do this:  Play hard then rest, and play hard again. Cats are built for short spurts of energy and a good play session consists of several highs and lows. Play into this by tiring out your cat for a few minutes, letting it rest, and then restarting play again and repeat. The time it takes for your cat to tire itself out will decrease the longer you play. Act as prey. Playing is more than just waving a toy in your cat's face. This can be more annoying than fun for your cat. Mimic a prey's movements by moving the toy away from your cat, darting behind objects to hide, or jumping away from your cat. Kittens are much more active than adult cats. It may take an hour or longer to tire them out. Some cat owners might be working all day or don't have enough time to play with their cats. A good way to incorporate play and encourage activity throughout the day is to provide your cat with things to do and see at home without you. You can try:  Hiding toys or treats around the house. This teaches your cat to hunt and is a good form of play when you're not around. Using a puzzle feeder so your cat is mentally stimulated around mealtimes. Turning on Cat TV. This might mean keeping your television on with the nature channel for your cat to watch. Or putting bird feeders by windows for your cat to bird-watch. Another way to keep your cat busy and also encourage good behaviour is to train your cat. Cats usually repeat an action if it produces a positive consequence or a reward at the end. This is different from training an animal what not to do, which relies on giving an animal negative consequences for negative behaviours. Cats don't do well with negative consequences or punishments which can encourage more aggressive or unwanted behaviours. Try:   Clicker training. Using a small plastic device with a metal strip that makes a loud clicking noise when pressed, you can condition your cat to associate the sound with a positive reward. Every time your cat does something you want, be sure to \"click\" immediately upon performing the action and then give it a treat or their favourite food. There are many ways to clicker train. One way is to start clicker training by giving your cat a treat right at the moment you click. In the end, your cat will understand that a \"click\" means a \"treat\".  Leash training. If your cat is an indoor cat, consider taking your cat outside for a walk or just to explore. This is a safer way for indoor kitties to explore the wild. Start by purchasing a harness for cats or a small harness for dogs, and a leash. Never use collared leashes as this can restrict a cat's airway or hurt their neck. Collared leashes also provide you with less control over your cat, especially if they scare easily and bolt off. Put the harness on your cat indoors first to let it get used to the feel of it. This may take a few days or weeks until your cat can walk properly with a harness on. You can train it to follow you indoors with clicker training or just follow it around with their leash on. Eventually, you can introduce it to the outside world.  With any training, it is important to be patient and to understand your cat's personality. Some cats do very well with training, some cats may take weeks to months before they can be trained, and some have personalities that don't do well with training. For example, a fearful cat would not do well with leash training and wearing a harness or going outside.", "output": "Jouez avec votre chat avant son dernier repas de la journée. Fatiguez votre chat.

When doing so, be sure to remove all the food in the refrigerator. Get at least one strong person to help you.  Do not leave any shelves in the refrigerator.

It’s vital to begin your entry into this religion through an appreciation of its foundation elements.   The Trimūrti is a concept in Hinduism \"in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer.\" However in most Puranic texts, Brahma's creative activity depends on the presence and power of a higher god.  Traditionally, Hinduism prescribed a strictly ordered social varna system with 4 main groups: Brahmin (priests), Kshatriyas (nobles and warriors or leaders), Vaishyas (craftsmen and farmers or profit-minded), and Shudras (skilled/unskilled laborers). With possible myth, a fifth “untouchable” class which is said to be outside of the Varna system, doesn't exist. Hindu religion doesn't divide people into categories and classes. The Varna system defines one's varna quotient and one can possess all varna quotient with one or more prominent.   Karma refers to a cause-and-effect system where one’s deeds and acts influence what happens in life. Each person creates their own destiny through their actions in life: if one conducts good deeds, they will reap good consequences later on in life.   Dharma refers to God’s divine law which orders the cosmos. When we follow dharma, our souls are brought into harmony and advanced towards God, truth, and righteousness.   Reincarnation, also known as punarjanma, is a cyclic process of birth, life, death, and rebirth. Instead of an afterlife, as is found in Judeo-Christian religions, Hindus believe that the immortal soul continues to exist after the death of the body, and is reborn into subsequent new bodies.  The actions that one completes in life (their karma) influence how the souls is reborn (for example, as a lower order life-form).  Once one resolves or “perfects” their karma, the soul breaks free from the reincarnation cycle.  Hindus also traditionally believe in Chakras. There are 7 Chakras, or energy centers, located throughout the body and connected to one’s spirit. Believers can purify or open up their Chakras through yoga mediation. While there is a wide array of perspectives on the “Divine” as well as a host of deity figures, all Hindus worship a Supreme Being who is unchanging, all-present, timeless, formless, and pure love. More than most major religions, Hinduism accepts and even celebrates pluralism. It is open to multiple types of practices and traditions.  The Hindu phrase, “May good thoughts come to us from all sides,” reflects this open and accepting nature. It indicates that all can (and should) seek out enlightenment from multiple sources and perspectives rather than from one dogma. Hindus do not ascribe to any one creed, and do not believe that there is any one singular view, reality, or way to reach God. Contemporary Hindus tend to practice tolerance and acceptance as an important religious virtue, rather than being exclusionary or narrow-minded. There are 4 main denominations within Hinduism. Though each have their differences, they also share a common purpose: to further the soul's journey towards its divine destiny.  Under Shaivism, Hindus worship the Supreme God as Shiva, (“the Compassionate One”). Shaivite Hindus value self discipline, follow a guru, worship in a temple, and practice yoga in order become one with Shiva. Followers of Shaktism worship the Supreme as the Divine Mother, Shakti or Devi, and use chants, magic, yoga, and other rituals to channel cosmic forces and awaken one’s spine Chakra. In Vaishnavism, worshipers seek the Supreme as Lord Vishnu and His incarnations, Krishna and Rama. Vaishnavites are deeply devotional and invested in saints, temples, and scriptures. Followers of Smartism, worship the Supreme in one of six forms: Ganesha, Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Surya and Skanda. They accept all the major Hindu Gods and are thus known as the most liberal or nonsectarian Hindus. They follow a philosophical, meditative path and strive after oneness with God through understanding. These texts were written at different times in Hindu history and offer different perspectives on Hindu tenets.  The Bhagavad Gita (usually considered part of larger book, Mahabharata), is a central text of Hinduism. It is structured as a philosophical dialog between the deity Krishna and the warrior Arjuna. The Bhagavad Gita is consider to be the most popular and accessible of the sacred texts and is the ideal book to start with as a beginner interested in Hinduism.  The Vedas are another primary Hindu text. There are 4 books in the ‘’‘Vedas’’’(the Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda) which contain hymns, incantations, rituals, a unique view of everyday life in ancient India.  The Upanishads detail how the soul (Atman) can be united with the ultimate truth (Brahman). This is accomplished through contemplation and mediation, as well as establishing good karma.  The Puranas offer a narrative history of the Universe from creation to destruction, as well as tales of kings, heroes, and demigods. In the Hindu pantheon, God takes on many forms and appears as several deities. While it is commonly stated that there are 330 million Hinduism deities, there are some main or more recognizable ones that you should try to learn.    Ganesha (elephant god) is the son of Shiva and considered to be the god of success, prosperity and divinity. Before starting any main activity (like a new business, purchasing/building a house, doing daily pooja, etc.)  Ganesha is the first to be worshipped.  Brahma is the creator of all reality.  Vishnu is the preserver of order.  Shiva is the God of Gods. He is also tasked with the destruction of the universe, so it can be remade.

Ideas about what is \"flattering\" and what is \"sexy\" are highly subjective across cultures, and if you want to build a positive body self-image, it's important for you to decide how you can clothe yourself to feel like the most confident version of yourself.  In general, it's good to put less stock in what fashion magazines have to say about the way you dress yourself. \"Feeling confident\" isn't synonymous with \"being trendy,\" especially if current trends involve super-tight high-waisted pants. Try to strike a balance between comfort and a style you like. It's over-simple to say that clothes don't matter. While they're not as important to work on as other things, it can be a big confidence booster to put some thought into your appearance, and clothes are one of the easiest ways to do this. Would a leather jacket make you confident? Consider it.

Make sure that you press yourself to the wall, leave at least an inch or two between you and the corner so you stay hidden, and that you carefully turn one ear toward the source. You can also crouch by the corner and listen this way, but this will make it a bit harder to come up with an excuse if you're caught. If you hear the person approaching, just casually walk up the stairs to cross their path with an idea of what you're setting out to do. It's better to do this than to have the person see you scurrying down the stairs. This is another great way to spy on someone in your house. You can be in the next room, doing homework, while listening to everything they are talking about. If you want to spy on your sister in the basement, go to the room next to it to fold your laundry; if you want to spy on your dad, who is fixing up the garage, act like you're raking leaves outside. Of course, the quieter the activity you're doing nearby, the better. Don't do something completely out of the ordinary that you would never normally do —like suddenly doing the dishes when you haven't done them for months —or that will arouse even more suspicion. If you're a kid, then your parents are probably used to you going around with your headphones in, rocking out to music all the time. If this is what you do —or if you want to get into the habit of doing this around the house so people think it's normal for you —then it can be a great way to have people reveal private information in the same room as you because they don't think you're listening.  Though this may not always work, if you always putter around the house with your headphones in, laughing to yourself, and looking like you're in your own world, people will get into the habit of thinking that you're not really there, and they may inadvertently say something around you because they think you're not listening. You should still have some music playing, such as classical music or jazz, just in case you're caught out. Just play it at a low volume. Listening in on the other line while your parents or siblings are talking on the house phone is another great way to spy. The important thing here is to anticipate the conversation before it happens, so you've already picked up the phone when the person sets out to make the call. If you pick up the phone after the person does, then they'll be able to hear you before they make the call.  If the phone rings for your mom or sibling and you want to stay on the line, then pick it up first, yell for the person to get it, and once they do, place the phone down and pick it back up, so it looks like you've put down the receiver. It's particularly important to avoid breathing heavily when you spy over the phone. You can even hold the phone close to your ear but a bit away from your mouth to minimize suspicion. If you want to be able to spy on people at home, then you have to practice breathing as shallowly as possible. If you breathe too heavily, then your sibling or family member will instantly turn around and you'll be caught. You need to practice taking slow, shallow breaths, out of your nose if possible, so that your breathing doesn't catch anyone's attention. You should also work on learning to hold a sneeze or to suppress a cough. You don't want your allergies to give you away, either. A web camera with motion detection can be a huge asset to a spy's computer. If you set it to turn on whenever anyone walks in the room, then it'll automatically start recording the person who is in there, and you'll be able to see exactly what that person has been up to. This is a great way to spy on people in your house. If you have a laptop, you can even leave it in different parts of your house \"by accident\" so you're more likely to be able to record people. If you place a glass to the wall with the bottom facing your ear and the open part of the glass to the wall, you'll be able to slightly amplify the sound in the next room.

Depending on your activity level, pick a daily allotment and stick with it. To lose 5 pounds a week, you must burn 2,500 calories a day, which is very difficult. Calculate how many calories you need to eat and how much you'll need to exercise to meet your goal. . This keeps you accountable, because you must record every nibble (even just a bite of a chocolate bar!). It also allows you to see any patterns or places where you can make changes if you aren't losing weight.  Don't miss a meal! Staying conscious of your eating habits is the first step to changing them. Work with a friend. Having someone else look over your food journal (and looking over theirs) will help motivate you to stay on track. Consider using an app on your smartphone, like MyFitnessPal, which makes it easy to track your calories throughout the day, as well as exercise and hydration. Healthier foods fill our stomachs up faster. If you feel full and content, you'll be less tempted to graze in front of the fridge.  Stock up on fruits and veggies. Let's say you eat 400 calories-worth of junk food. You're probably going to be going back to the fridge in minutes. That's because the oils in junk foods aren't filling. They literally take up less volume in your stomach than fruits and veggies do. To eat 400 calories-worth of lettuce, you'd have to eat about 65 pounds of it.  Avoid processed goods. They've lost 90% of their nutrients already. These foods leave you craving more because they don't satisfy any of your nutritional needs. Consume the rainbow.

In addition to fruits and vegetables, egg whites, soy products, skinless poultry breasts, fish, shellfish, nonfat dairy foods, and 95% lean meat are all recommended for rapid weight loss. . And then drink some more. A glass of ice cold water will boost your metabolism (your body works to warm it) within 10 minutes. Drink a glass of water before every meal. This will start up your body's CCK, the hormone that signals to your brain that you are full. You'll eat less because your body will tell you to! . Skipping breakfast actually contributes to gaining weight because you are likely to eat more in the middle of the day. In addition, having breakfast will kickstart your metabolism for the day and get you burning calories.  Stick to a 300-calorie breakfast. This is enough to give you that kickstart and but no so many calories that you'll have to make sacrifices at lunch and dinner. Stay away from morning carbohydrates like bagels and pancakes. Your body is more likely to turn them to fat. Instead, try a chia seed breakfast bowl, oatmeal with fruit, a breakfast burrito with scrambled eggs and veggies, or a smoothie.

While there is little scientific data backing the efficacy of moisturizing creams, many people with stretch marks report fading after a few weeks to a few months.

Moisturizers are claimed to be more effective when the stretch marks are new, and still a bright red or purple color. Tretinoin is commonly used to treat stretch marks and scars such as those caused by acne. Generally, a topical tretinoin cream will be prescribed by a doctor. Schedule an appointment with your doctor and let them know that you are interested in trying a tretinoin treatment.  Tretinoin is not recommended for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Tretinoin is generally applied as a topical cream, and can be applied on the back using hands or a lotion brush. Lower dosage retinoid creams can be purchased over the counter at most pharmacies and markets. Their diluted formulas may compromise their efficacy, though. One of the most effective home treatments for stretch marks is simply allowing them to fade.

Form a committee that's made up of individuals from each of these populations to develop a program that takes into account everyone's needs and addresses everyone's concerns. Designate one person as the representative for each group so that they can explain the need for recycling to their peers and ask for their support.  They can also help communicate program developments and changes and be the \"point person\" for questions that arise. In some cities, paper recycling is the law and collected paper will be picked up on scheduled trash days.  In other locations, you'll need to find a drop-off point or pick-up service to take your paper.  The website Earth911 has a search feature that allows you find recycling services in your area.  You can also search online to find a local materials recovery center or recycling drop-off center and see if they'll accept your paper. If you can't find a drop-off center for your paper, you may have to explore paying for a pick-up service to haul it away.  Research costs associated with this to be sure if will ultimately benefit your school. Depending on how and where you'll dispose of your recycled paper, you may have to limit or separate what you collect.  Some collection locations will accept \"single stream,\" meaning a variety of paper grades mixed in one collection box, or they'll want \"sorted stream\" drop-offs, meaning you'll need to separate papers by grades (there are five basic paper grade types.)  Certain types may not be accepted at all.  Find out what and how your collection agency takes and structure your program accordingly.   Old corrugated containers.  Also known as “corrugated cardboard,” this kind of paper is typically found in boxes and product packaging.  Mixed paper.  This broad category includes things like mail, catalogs, phone books and magazines.  Old newspapers. The name of this category says it all.  High grade de-inked paper.  Your school will undoubtedly have the most of this kind of paper, which includes things such as envelopes, copy paper and letterhead.  Pulp substitutes.  This paper is usually discarded scraps from mills, so it's unlikely you'll have to worry about it, although there's always a chance that it could be a part of paper products your school buys. See if your local recycling center can provide you with collection boxes; otherwise, purchase some plastic tubs to serve the purpose.  Keep them all the same color and/or clearly mark them as paper collection boxes so that no one accidentally puts garbage in them. If you must sort your paper, use labels or images of the kinds of paper that should be deposited into each different box. Not only do you need everyone on board for your program to be a success, but everyone should be well informed and clear as to how the program works.  Consider asking environmental science or social studies instructors to devote a class period to discussing the guidelines of the recycling program.  Or plan to have educational assemblies for explaining the program, including information about what kind(s) of paper is being accepted and the location of the collection bins. Create a reference card with information about the program to distribute to everyone in the school.  Or, to save paper, create a web site or page on your school's site where everyone can reference program guidelines. You'll need a place where you can store the collected paper between recycling drop offs or pick ups.  The copy machine room may be a good choice or perhaps a section of a large storage closet. Put safety first and do not allow large piles of paper to block exits or be stored near flammable chemicals.  Check with your local code enforcement office to make certain you're in compliance with all applicable building and fire codes. Once your recycling program is off the ground, keep people excited about it by reporting on it's progress and recycling and savings goals you meet.  Make weekly or monthly announcements over the PA system or via your school's closed circuit television of the amount of paper that's been recycled to date.  Remind everyone of the importance of maintaining the program and use the opportunity to clarify any confusion and address any questions or concerns that have been raised. Plan field trips to your local recycling center or invite guest speakers to come to your school to discuss the value of a recycling program and its positive financial and environmental impact. If your school is reluctant to establish a recycling program, ask if you can conduct a simple paper waste audit to find out what is being thrown out and from where.

Designate particular hours for writing, and do your best to stick to them – you are “on the clock.”  The best working hours will depend on your individual circumstances, but consider setting time aside when your children are usually asleep. This might mean getting up early (before your children) or staying up late (after your children have gone to bed). If your children attend school, use those hours for work. Make older children aware of your work schedule. If you must work while your children are present, teach them that you are “at work” during certain times, and encourage them to avoid disturbing you. Just as you must protect your working time, you need to make time for undisturbed interaction with your children. Designate particular hours for high-quality family time, and do your best to stick to them.

If your children's grandparents live nearby and are willing to help, let your children spend some time with them while you work! If you have other relatives or friends who offer assistance, accept their help, and try not to feel guilty – it's good for your children to spend time with other people, and it's good for your family for you to make extra money.

For example: Hello, Goodbye, How are you?, I am good, What is your name?, My name is____, and so on. It will make it significantly easier for you and you will be able to read and pronounce words, which will help you memorize them with greater ease. Plus, it is better for you to be sounding the words out rather than looking at the romanization for the words. Mastering basic vocabulary is probably one of the most important things you can do when learning a new language. Even if you can't understand whole sentences, the ability to pick out keywords can help you to understand the general meaning of a speech or text.  Focus on 100 most common words. Picking out the most common 100 words in a given language is a clever way to start. From there, you can work your way up to the most common 1000 words. It is estimated that learning the 1000 most common words in a language will allow you to understand 70% of any text. Focus on the vocabulary that is most relevant to you -- learn business vocabulary if you're learning a language for business, don't waste time learning the words for different species of fish (which you might want to do if you're traveling to go scuba diving!) You should also learn words and vocabulary that pertain specifically to you, so you're able to talk about your life and your background to people you meet. Start off by learning to count to ten, because it is usually the easiest thing to memorize at first. Each day learn a new set of ten numbers, keep going each day until you are satisfied with how high you can count. If you are up for a challenge, memorize all the numbers up to one hundred in one day. The reason why most people can't remember most of the language they spent years learning in school is that school curricula tend to focus a huge amount of time on learning grammar and very little time on speech. This is pretty much backwards -- if you want to learn a language quickly, you should learn how to converse first. The specifics of grammar will come later.  Of course, there's no denying that grammar is important -- you need to learn how to conjugate basic everyday verbs and have some idea of the correct word order in a sentence. The point is that you shouldn't spend hours and hours learning verb tables by heart, or worrying about the specific circumstances in which a certain preposition can be used. You'll learn these things as you go along! Pronunciation is another place where you should focus your energies. There's no point in memorizing hundreds of words and phrases if you pronounce them so oddly that they can't be understood. Therefore, it's important that when you learn a word, you learn the pronunciation simultaneously.  Pronunciation can be difficult to learn from a book -- so this is where chatting with native speakers (or using interactive software programs and applications) comes in handy. You need to actually say the word out loud in order to learn how to pronounce it correctly. If you're practicing with an actual person, make sure that they're not too timid to correct you when you pronounce a word incorrectly, otherwise you may never fully get the hang of it. Remember -- pronunciation can be the difference between speaking a language well and speaking a language fluently. When you're learning a new language you can't be afraid to make mistakes, otherwise you won't get very far.  You're bound to get yourself in a few embarrassing situations, but what's the big deal? The native speakers might have a good chuckle, but they'll still appreciate the effort you're making and be willing to help you out. You are not aiming for perfection here, you are aiming for progress.

Whether you’re helping children and adults learn to read at your local library or working a soup kitchen in your community, volunteering can help you get in touch with your sense of gratitude and help people who really need you. It can be incredibly humbling to spend time with people who are grateful for your help, and it can make you be more gracious and less likely to feel entitled.  Volunteer for the sake of it, not for the bragging rights. You don’t need to tell your fifty closest friends that you’re volunteering just to show off. Of course, if you’re genuinely proud and want to talk about it, that’s another thing. Giving your time to help others can make you realize that you don’t always need to put yourself first. This can make you live a life filled with humility. To practice gratitude on a regular basis, you should avoid comparing yourself to others, whether you’re jealous of your neighbors, your best friend, or even Taylor Swift. Focus on being grateful for what you have and enjoying your life on its own terms instead of thinking you need to have what your best friend or co-worker has to truly be happy. If you spend your life comparing yourself to others, then you will never feel like what you have is enough, and you won’t be humbled before all that you have been given.  You can admire other people and feel inspired to be better because of them. But if you covet what they have, you are likely to fall into feelings of bitterness that will keep you from enjoying your life. Don’t gossip about people or put them down because you’re secretly jealous of them, either. Humble people only say nice things about people behind their backs. People who practice humility are the first to admit that they don’t know everything. Whether you’re getting tips from a co-worker or a friend, it’s important to be open to new possibilities and new knowledge. Let people see that you think they have a lot to offer you, and avoid acting stubborn or like you know everything. Even if you may feel like an expert on a topic, remember that you can always learn more; it’s humbling to admit that you’re a student of life.  Don’t get defensive when someone is trying to teach you something. If that person has pure intentions, then you should make an effort to hear him out. You don’t want people to feel like you think you have all the answers, or they won’t be eager to share their experiences with you. If you want to practice humility, then not all of your kind deeds have to go noticed. Donate money to charity without telling a soul about it, or donate your old clothes without saying a thing. If you notice that a person’s parking meter is expired, throw in a few quarters. Help crowdfund a worthy project. Anonymously post a kind comment on a person’s blog. Take the time to do something nice without wanting anything in return, and you will be on your way to practicing humility every day.  If you’re the only person who is aware of the good you’ve done in the world, there is something especially humbling about the experience. You can even write about the experience in a journal if you feel like telling someone. People who practice humility aren’t often seen complaining because they realize that life is precious and that they have so much to be grateful for. Sure, we’ve all had bad days, and it’s okay to vent once in a while, but you shouldn’t make a habit of it if you want to practice humility. Remember that so many people have it so much worse than you, and that complaining about every little thing that happened to you instead of focusing on the positive will keep you from practicing humility.  People are drawn to appreciative, positive people. If you complain all the time or form relationships based on complaining all the time, then you’ll be less likely to live a humility-filled life. Whenever you catch yourself complaining about something, try to counter that comment with two positive comments. There’s something very humbling about being in nature, whether you take a long hike through the woods or you spend a day just lying on the beach. Nature can remind you that there are things bigger than ourselves and our problems out there, and that we should be in awe of the world instead of obsessing over all of our little problems or thwarted ambitions. Making a habit of being in nature more often can lead you to practice humility more. Your problems won’t seem as severe when you’re standing at the base of a mountain. As corny as it sounds, being around nature will make you see that you’re just a grain of sand on the beach that is the universe, and that you should be thankful for what you have instead of bemoaning what you wish you had. Children have a natural sense of wonder and almost never cease to be in awe of the universe. If you want to practice humility more often, then you should make a habit of spending more time with children. They’ll help you see the world through new, youthful eyes, and you’ll be able to rediscover some of the magic you may feel that you lost because of the daily grind. Making a habit of spending more time with kids, whether you spend more time with your own, volunteer with children, or help a friend out by babysitting, can help you practice humility regularly.  You may think that you have a lot to teach children and will feel humbled when you see that they have a lot to teach you, too. Listen to their perspective about the world and see how it can help you become a more humble, grateful person. Being around children will help you rejuvenate your sense of wonder. This can help you be more appreciative of the world around you and it will keep you from taking anything for granted. Yoga is a practice devoted to being grateful for the body you have been given and your time on this earth. Though some yoga practices can be a great workout, too, the most important thing with yoga is being in touch with your mind and body and not taking a single one of your breaths for granted. If you want to work on practicing humility more, then you should make yoga a regular part of your life. Taking just 2-3 classes a week can transform the way you look at the world. If you feel like you just can’t make the time to go to a yoga class, you can practice at home.", "output": "Faites du bénévolat. Ne vous comparez pas aux autres. Soyez prêt à apprendre.

Other viruses cause serious, life-threatening diseases such as cancer and Ebola. Some persistent viruses cause long-term disorders including hepatitis, HSV and varicella-zoster (causing chickenpox and shingles) and HIV. Until relatively recently, there were no effective antiviral drugs. That is changing, with more antiviral drugs being introduced.   Antiviral therapy is important for certain infections, including infections with herpes viruses (HSVs), cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Another approach to treating viral infection is to use interferons. These are natural substances (cytokines) released from infected cells which function to block various facets of viral replication.

Shave in the shower to keep your skin moist the whole time. The warm water will also help soften your hair. Never dry-shave – your skin should be moist and lubricated when you shave. Lather up with a rich shave gel or cream to protect your skin. Use products that are fragrance-free and non-comedogenic (won’t clog pore) if you have sensitive skin. Apply the cream or gel five minutes before shaving to soften up the hair. Shaving cuts hairs short and makes them sharp – that’s why it’s easy for them to turn back in on themselves, pierce the skin, and become ingrown. Use a razor with a single blade instead of multiple blades so that the hairs aren’t quite as short or sharp. Replace your razor blades every 5-7 shaves so that they stay clean and sharp. Always rinse your razor when you’re done shaving to get soap and hairs off of it. Shave with, not against, the grain of your hair. This prevents hair from being cut too short and irritating your skin, and decreases the likelihood of ingrown hairs. Do not shave the same area of skin over and over again. This can irritate your skin and cut the hairs very short, possibly resulting in more ingrown hairs. Shave over an area one time only. Using a high-quality, lubricating shave gel can help make this more effective. It may seem tedious, but take the time to rinse off your blade after every stroke you make. This will keep your blade cleaner and produce a more even, less irritating shave. Don’t pull your skin taut while you shave over it. This can let the hair follicle slip back under the skin. It may take some practice, but work on shaving your neck without pulling on your skin. Lift and move your chin and jaw to different angles to get those hard-to-reach places. Electric razors do not give you as close of a shave as razor blades do. Because they don’t cut the hair as short, electric razors may be less likely to cause ingrown hairs. Consider trying one out to see if it helps. You can also use a clipper or beard trimmer. These often allow you to choose what closeness setting you want.

Use this stroke to start, or if you want to take a break from the more technical breathing required for other strokes. The backstroke can improve your posture by extending your back and shoulder muscles.  Try to keep your body as flat as possible at the surface of the water. If you let your hips dip too far down, it can slow you down. The backstroke is more or less the same as freestyle, only you're laying on your back instead of on your stomach. When you swim the backstroke, you'll be looking at the ceiling the whole time. Identify markers that will let you know when you're near the end of your lane so you don't run into the wall. The freestyle stroke is perhaps the most popular competitive swimming stroke, and it's good for stretching your entire body. You'll get a particularly good workout of your shoulders and back, biceps, triceps, quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings.  To swim freestyle, you'll be on your stomach in the water. Push off from the wall and extend your arms straight out in front of you. You'll pull your body forward with your arms by lowering one arm at a time deep into the water and circling it back around when it reaches the outside of your thigh. As you're bringing one arm up, push the other arm down to repeat the motion. Rotate your body with the stroke. Do flutter kicks with your legs to help propel your body forward. You may want to practice your flutter kicks while holding on to the wall. While the breaststroke can be technically difficult to perform well, it can be a relaxing stroke because you can better control the pace. It provides the same whole-body benefits as freestyle, and can be a good stroke to alternate for slower laps.  For the breaststroke, move both of your arms at the same time. Start on your stomach on the water with your arms out in front of you. Starting at your chin, push your palms forward, out, and down, keeping your hands in front of your shoulders at all times. Keep your hands in a spear-point shape. Continue the cycle, bringing your hands out of the water and then back down again. For the breaststroke kick, bring your knees together and tuck them in towards your body, then push them out, kicking your feet out in a circular motion – out, and then coming back together again. Coordinate your arms and legs so that you're kicking out as your arms are up out of the water, and tucking your knees in as you push your hands down into the water. The breaststroke may exacerbate existing neck, back, or knee injuries. If these areas are an issue for you, talk to your health care provider before you start doing the breaststroke. The butterfly stroke is a difficult stroke to pull off technically, and exhausting to maintain physically. But if you are swimming several different strokes, it can provide a break from the monotony.  Pull your arms forward, out, and then down to form a \"Y\" shape in front of your body. Push them down and back along the sides of your body and then shove them forward to start the stroke again. These movements should be powerful, using your full range of motion. To kick, keep your legs, knees, and feet together like a dolphin tail. Break the surface of the water with your heels and the soles of your feet, then push your feet down against the water to propel yourself forward. The butterfly stroke is a real calorie burner that can help you burn as many as 800 calories in an hour. If you need to improve the efficiency or power of your kicks, kick board laps allow you to focus on your kick strokes without worrying about your arms. You also can use kick board laps as a restful break between harder, faster swimming laps.", "output": "Nagez sur le dos. Pratiquez le crawl. Faites la brasse. Tentez le papillon.

Regular exercise is a great option for getting your circulation going, and promoting circulation also helps keep your skin healthy and vibrant-looking.  If you are generally healthy, aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Consult your doctor if you are sedentary or have health concerns. Shower or clean yourself after you exercise. When you sweat, your pores can get clogged with salty, dirty residue that's left over from your workout.

Talk to your doctor or dermatologist about the best sunscreen for your skin type and acne situation. Wear sunscreen when exercising outdoors. The benefits of getting your circulation jump-started can be outweighed by the disadvantages of sun damage. If you have severe or persistent acne, there are several medication options. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist about which medications might be most effective for you.  For females, oral contraceptives are sometimes used to treat acne. Birth control medications regulate the hormones produced by the body, and may cut down on breakouts. Other oral antibiotics attack the bacteria that causes acne. They can assist in reducing the number of breakouts and fighting inflammation. For severe cases, isotretinoin (Accutane) is a vitamin-A derivative that shrinks the glands that produce sebum. It comes with various risks and side-effects, which you should fully understand before embarking on a course of treatment.

You'll need A & D ointment, which is usually used for diaper rash, and petroleum jelly. Combine 1 cup of each in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup of vitamin E cream and 1/4 cup aloe vera cream. Stir the mixture well. It will be pretty stiff, but you can spread it on chafed skin. Spread the lubricant on areas that usually chafe before you plan on exercising or sweating. It can also help heal chafed skin and prevent blisters. If you're overweight, you may notice more chafing. This is especially true if you notice chafing on your thighs. Losing some of the weight will help prevent excess skin from rubbing together in the future. Start by exercising and incorporating healthy food into your diet. You can do an exercise that doesn't cause significant chafing, like swimming weightlifting, or rowing.", "output": "Gardez une peau sèche. Portez les vêtements adéquats. Buvez plus d’eau.

If you are unsure, consult the directions for your sewing machine and adjust settings accordingly.  Also prepare your sewing machine by threading it with a thread that matches the color and strength of the material you are going to sew. This is also a good time to plug in your iron, so that it's already heated up when you need it. Putting the wrong sides together is the opposite of what is normally done when sewing a basic seam, so don't worry if it feels counterintuitive. A French seam requires you to stitch each seam twice, folding over your first line of stitches in order to make your finished seam face the right direction.   Be sure to pin all the way down the seam you are sewing. This will help to make sure your fabric doesn't slip out of line. It's a good idea to put pins in so they are perpendicular to your seam line, this way they won't stick you as you move the fabric along in the sewing machine and they will be easy to grab as you move your fabric in the sewing machine. To keep your seam allowance the same width as you sew your seam, keep an eye on the seam allowance guide that should be printed on the thread plate of your machine. Another option is to use a 1/4 inch presser foot, that way you can just make sure the outer edge of your fabric always lines up with the edge of the presser foot.  The seam allowance is the amount of fabric that is between the edge of the fabric and the seam.  Patterns usually give a specific amount of seam allowance to use, so that your finished project doesn't turn out too bit or too small.   Remember that the french seam will basically require about double the allowance you use on this first seam, so make sure when you are cutting out your pieces of fabric that you have figured that into your measurements. Feel free to increase the seam allowance on this first seam to 3/8 inch, if you are more comfortable sewing that width, but keep in mind that you will need to increase your overall seam allowance to accommodate this. It's best to remove pins right before you are about to sew over them.  This will keep the fabric in place but will avoid the risk of hitting one with your sewing machine needle, which could easily break the needle. Remember to clip any threads and remove any remaining pins after sewing. You can use regular scissors or pinking shears, but if you are using a delicate fabric, pinking shears may be best to help prevent excessive fraying.  Remember, this seam is not going to show by the time you are finished. Don't worry if the cut edge is a bit frayed or messy. While it would be great if you could just sew a 1/8 inch seam, and therefore not waste any fabric, most sewing machines need more than 1/8 inch of fabric for the machine's feed dogs, the pieces of rough metal under the presser foot, to grab onto and pull along. Open the pieces of fabric and lay it out flat on an ironing board. Iron across the seam on both the right side and the wrong side of the fabric so it lays perfectly flat. Then fold the fabric so that the right sides are facing each other (the opposite of how it was when you sewed the first seam). Iron the piece with the seam you just sewed going straight down the outer edge of the fabric. You'll want to iron very carefully and neatly so that the seam on the outer edge is perfectly straight. Make sure your iron is set to the correct temperature for the fabric you are using. If it is set to high you will risk singeing the fabric.     {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a3\\/Sew-a-French-Seam-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-459px-Sew-a-French-Seam-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a3\\/Sew-a-French-Seam-Step-6.jpg\\/aid1338152-v4-728px-Sew-a-French-Seam-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"485\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}", "output": "Préparez la machine à coudre.

Keep your shoulders straight and squared, your head upright, and your neck, back, and heels aligned. Align your back with the back of the office chair. This will help you avoid slouching or leaning forward, which you may find yourself doing after sitting too long at your desk. Put your hands under your sit bones while you are sitting on the floor. Make sure that your palms are facing down. Adjust your position until you can feel the weight centered on each of your palms. This is your optimal seated position. Your feet should be flat on the floor, facing forward. Don't cross your legs or ankles. Make your thighs parallel to the floor. If your feet don't touch the floor, use a footrest. Use a chair that's ergonomically designed for proper support, meaning it supports all of your back, even the curve at the bottom. Also, make sure it's designed for your height and weight. If you can't get a new ergonomic chair option, try using a small pillow for lumbar support in the small of your back. If you work on computers at an office, angle the monitor slightly upward so that it forces you to sit up. However, don't set it so high that you push your chin out to see it.  You may need to move your chair up or down if you can't angle the monitor properly. Adjust your chair and your position so that your arms are flexed, not straight out. Aim for roughly a 75- to 90-degree angle at the elbows. If they are too straight, you're too far back, and if they are more than 90 degrees, you're either sitting too close or you're slouching. Adjust your seat to maintain a proper distance from the pedals and steering wheel. If you're leaning forward, pointing your toes, or reaching for the wheel, you're too far away. If you are bunched up with your chin on top of the steering wheel, you're too close.  Use lumbar support for the curve of your back when possible. Adjust the head rest so the middle of your head rests against it. Your head shouldn't be more than 4 inches (10 cm) away from the headrest while driving. Keep your back against the seat and your head against the head rest. Your knees should be at the same level as your hips or slightly above. Good posture is also important for safety in the car. Your car's protective systems protect you best when you are sitting properly in the seat. Even if you're using perfect posture while sitting, you need to stand up and stretch or walk every hour or so. Just walking around the room or getting out of your car for a few minutes can help.  If you tend to get engrossed in your work, set an alarm to remind yourself to take a break.

If you disregard this principle and leave stubs from the places where you've cut, the stubs will heal more slowly. It also leaves the plant more susceptible to insects and diseases. Cut branches off at the main branch or an intersecting branch in order to thin out the bush and create a more even distribution of branches throughout the shrub. Be sure to cut strategically: cutting far back into the shrub means that future growth on that site is unlikely, as older wood does not regenerate as easily as new wood.

While lenders do not have to charge an explicit rate in a lease agreement in the U.S., finance firms making the loan are required to calculate the cost of borrowing for you.

If the total cost of the lease is $1,000 and the company makes 12 payments of $100 per month, then the lease agreement has an implicit interest rate of 20%. When purchasing bonds, an implicit interest rate is the difference between the current yield (dividend) paid on a bond and the rate that the bondholder will receive at a fixed point in the future. The implicit rate may change from the rate stated in the bond contract at the time of purchase, since bonds can rise or fall in value during the bond term. For example, you purchase bonds with a promised dividend of $5.00 per share to be paid in one year. Due to fluctuations in the marketplace, you receive $10.00 per share on the one-year due date. The implicit interest rate earned is 50%. If there is not an explicit interest stated, you should always calculate the implied interest rate before signing a lease or taking out a loan.

And we all continue to judge others based on first impressions we’ve taken of them. When you first meet your teacher, make sure that you are polite, hard-working, respectful, and ready to learn. It is possible that when your teacher goes to grade your assignment, they’ll be guided by the kind feelings they have towards you. They might be more likely to let an error slide and an inconsistency pass. The result of this may only be a couple of points, but those points add up. Do you tend to stare out of the window? Do you doodle nonstop while the teacher is talking? Do you pass notes constantly? All of these activities are common faux-pas. In the classroom, your goal should be to absorb as much information as possible. Doing so will reduce the time needed to comprehend the material later. Homework will become infinitely easier and take a fraction of the time used when you’re having to teach yourself the material. Take all the necessary steps before class to reduce distractions. Feed yourself. Get some sleep. Make phone calls ahead of time or take the time to text before entering the class. Ask questions. Answer your teacher’s questions. Participate in class dialogues. This step is essential for two reasons. First, it manages your teacher’s expectations further. It makes you seem like a motivated student. More importantly, if you take time to ask questions in class, you’ll probably understand the material better later on and will require less time to study or complete homework. Maybe this seems counterintuitive, but teachers need to know what their students don’t get. If you are open about not understanding the significance of asymptotes, the function of the mitochondria, or how to use a semicolon, your teacher will spend more time on the subject, which will help you in the long run to reduce the amount of work you have to complete. Furthermore, your teacher might cut you some slack if he sees you struggling with a subject. This will help you to focus and give the impression that you are willing to pay attention. Teachers know that serious students sit up front because it is difficult to hide things up front. You won’t be able to text or fall asleep without the teacher noticing. Many teachers test on their lectures exclusively or at least in addition to the materials found in the book. More importantly, your teacher will take the time to cover the most essential and perhaps the most difficult materials in class. Take excellent notes. Adopt a shorthand and be sure to note what your teacher spends more time on. More time spent covering it in class equals more likely it will be on the test. According to the Cornell note taking system, be sure to highlight key words and write questions you have in  the margins of your notes. Then ask your teacher them when you next see them.

There are some important questions to ask the breeder, rescue centre, or pet store before you buy a kitten. You should start by asking who bred the kitten, as well as inquiring about the health of the rest of the litter and the mother.  Specifically, you should find out if the mother has had her vaccinations and been wormed. If she hasn't, it is more likely that her kittens will have health problems. Ask how many litters the mother has had. If it is a lot, this may indicate irresponsible breeding and may suggest that the breeders are not taking good care of her. Ask if there are potential hereditary health problems that you should be aware of. As well as asking about the mother's medical condition, you should determine the medical status of the kitten before you take her home. Ask if the kitten has been wormed and has had her vaccinations. This should happen with veterinary supervision at an early stage, with the first vaccinations typically administered when she is eight or nine weeks old. Ensure you have the documentation from the vet to prove this.  Check if she has been microchipped. This is very important, and you can arrange for a vet to do this if the breeder hasn't done it yet. Finally, you should ask some questions about the kitten's first weeks. Where has she been kept? Has she had much contact with people or other animals? This information will help you understand your kitten. She will need plenty of contact with different people to become comfortable around humans. Before you bring her home it's sensible to find your local vet and give them a call to book her in for a check-up. All pets should be registered with a vet to help ensure they are taken good care of, and get all the necessary injections and veterinary care. When you take her in, be sure to bring documentation from the breeder and have any necessary vaccinations, or worming treatments carried out as soon as possible.  Your vet will also be able to give you guidance about nutrition and care. You should also consider getting pet insurance before your kitten gets home.

Talk with your doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions or symptoms so that s/he can find the medication that is best for you.  Your doctor may prescribe clomiphene (Clomid, Serophene) or letrozole (Femara). These are oral medications that you take at the first part of your menstrual cycle to stimulate ovulation. You will likely ovulate within 5-10 days after taking clomiphene or letrozole.  You should tell your doctor if you have endometriosis, uterine fibroids, a history of liver disease, or thyroid issues. Side effects of clomiphene or letrozole may include hot flashes, headaches, and breast pain/tenderness.  You should also be aware that in from 7-10 out of 100 pregnancies that result from clomiphene or letrozole therapy, multiple implantations occur. Twins are the most common.  If clomiphene does not work on its own, your doctor may prescribe a combination of metformin and clomiphene. If clomiphene treatment does not work, your doctor may prescribe gonadotropins. Gonadotropins are hormones that stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple follicles (cysts that contain eggs). Injections are usually started on the second or third day of your period and continued for 7 -12 days. These treatments can be expensive, so talk with your reproductive endocrinologist to make sure that they are right for you.  Gonadotropin injections have a relatively high success rate. Of the women who ovulate after gonadotropin therapy and don't have other factors compromising their fertility, up to 50% become pregnant within 4 to 6 ovulatory cycles.  Up to 30% of pregnancies from gonadotropin therapy are associated with multiple implantations. Most multiples are twins, although in 5% of cases it may be triplets or higher. Talk with your doctor about side effects. Most side effects from these injections are mild, but in some cases they may be more serious. A mild form of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) may occur in 10-30% of gonadotropin patients, and a severe form in about 1% of cases. In the severe cases, OHSS can cause nausea, vomiting, weight gain, blood clotting, and other serious symptoms. In IVF, a fertilized egg is surgically placed into the uterus. It is quite effective. However, IVF can often be expensive and is usually considered as an option when less expensive treatments have not worked. Talk with your doctor about whether you are a good candidate for IVF.  People with PCOS respond strongly to fertility medications, so they are often at higher risk for multiple births. IVF allows for the highest degree of controlling the possibility of multiple births. IVF may cause Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), which can be serious and under extremely rare circumstances can even be fatal. Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling, or Ovarian Diathermy, is a type of surgical treatment that can help stimulate ovulation in women with PCOS. It is not common and is generally considered a last resort for women for whom other fertility treatments have failed.  Ovarian drilling is done under general anesthesia. A surgeon clinically destroys part of the ovary using a laser or other device. This reduces the amount of testosterone produced by the ovaries, which can increase your possibility of ovulating. A few studies suggest that about 50% of women are able to become pregnant within a year after having this procedure, at least under the best possible circumstances. Ovarian drilling has serious risks, including infection, internal bleeding, injury to internal organs, and scarring. Always talk with your doctor about the risks and side effects before considering this procedure. When taking any medication or treatment, it is important to work closely with your doctor. This is especially important when you are taking reproductive treatments or therapies. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects from your medication. If you are seeing multiple doctors for your PCOS, such as a primary care physician, gynecologist, and endocrinologist, make sure to keep everyone informed about your health. If you experience any symptoms or side effects from treatment, make sure that your health care providers are aware.", "output": "Envisagez la pilule contraceptive.

They can dig under, chew through, or knock over fences that aren’t up to snuff, and have been known to figure out how to open a gate latch.  Invest in a sturdy fence — for instance, a chain link fence that’s buried into the ground to discourage digging under it.  No matter how good the fence is, though, make sure to inspect it regularly. A single pig should have at least 36 square meters (roughly 400 square feet) of roaming space. Add about 4.5 square meters (50 square feet) for each additional pig. Pigs aren’t dirty animals per se, but they do indeed love to roll around in the mud from time to time. In fact, since pigs don’t sweat, they need to wallow to ensure the proper regulation of body temperature, particularly in hot weather. The wallow can be very simple — a tilled up section of the yard that you hose down a few times per day — or can be sectioned off with wood of other edging materials.  You can fill a baby pool with water to let your pig cool off and splash around in. Depending on how hot it is, they may even want to use both. Indoor pigs will also enjoy a good wallow every so often; just hose them down when they’re done. For the best results, especially in hot weather, locate the wallow in a shady area. Make sure outdoor pigs have their own dry and sheltered sleeping spot. It needs to be at least partly covered for shading and to stay dry, and should be ventilated but not too breezy. Put down some “flooring” as well — piglets will burrow into hay, while adult pigs are usually happy with wood shavings (not sawdust).  Shelters can be purchased or built (look for instructions online); they should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) by 6 feet (1.8 m) in size for each adult pig sheltered inside.  Pigs thrive in temperatures between 12 and 26 degrees Celsius (54-79 degrees F); provide supplemental heating (via commercial pet enclosure heaters) or even cooling (via inaccessible fans) if necessary.", "output": "Donnez-lui un endroit clôturé de taille adaptée.

If you cannot form two right triangles because one side of the trapezoid is perpendicular to the base, just note that this side will have the same measurement as the height, and divide the trapezoid into one rectangle and one right triangle. Since these are opposite sides of a rectangle, they will be the same length. For example, if you have a trapezoid with a height of 6 cm, you should draw a line from each top vertex extending down to the bottom base. Label each line 6 cm. (This is the bottom side of the rectangle.) This length will be equal to the length of the top base, because opposite sides of a rectangle are of equal length. For example, if the top base of the trapezoid is 6 cm, then the middle section of the bottom base is also 6 cm. The ratio is sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta ={\\frac {\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}}}, where θ{\\displaystyle \\theta } is the measure of the interior angle, opposite{\\displaystyle {\\text{opposite}}} is the height of the triangle, and hypotenuse{\\displaystyle {\\text{hypotenuse}}} is the length of the hypotenuse.  Using this ratio will allow you to find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle, which is also the trapezoid's first side length. The hypotenuse is the side across from the 90 degree angle of a right triangle. Make sure you use the height of the triangle as the length of the opposite side in the formula. You will solve for H. For example, if the given interior angle is 35 degrees, and the height of the triangle is 6 cm, your formula will look like this:sin⁡(35)=6H{\\displaystyle \\sin(35)={\\frac {6}{H}}} Do this by using the SIN button on a scientific calculator. Plug this value into the ratio. For example, by using a calculator you will find that the sine of a 35 degree angle is .5738 (rounded). So your formula will now be:.5738=6H{\\displaystyle .5738={\\frac {6}{H}}} To do this, multiply each side by H, then divide each side by the angle sine. Or, you can simply divide the height of the triangle by the angle sine. For example:.5738=6H{\\displaystyle .5738={\\frac {6}{H}}}.5738H=6{\\displaystyle .5738H=6}.5738H.5738=6.5738{\\displaystyle {\\frac {.5738H}{.5738}}={\\frac {6}{.5738}}}H=10.4566{\\displaystyle H=10.4566}So, the length of the hypotenuse, and the first missing side of the trapezoid, is about 10.4566 cm. Set up the sine ratio (sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta ={\\frac {\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}}}) for the second given interior angle. This will give you the length of the hypotenuse, which is also the first side of the trapezoid. For example, if the given interior angle is 45 degrees, you would calculate:sin⁡(45)=6H{\\displaystyle \\sin(45)={\\frac {6}{H}}}.7071=6H{\\displaystyle .7071={\\frac {6}{H}}}.7071H=6{\\displaystyle .7071H=6}.7071H.7071=6.7071{\\displaystyle {\\frac {.7071H}{.7071}}={\\frac {6}{.7071}}}H=8.4854{\\displaystyle H=8.4854}So, the length of the hypotenuse, and the second missing side of the trapezoid, is about 8.4854 cm. The Pythagorean Theorem formula is a2+b2=c2{\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where the length of the hypotenuse is c{\\displaystyle c}, and the height of the triangle is a{\\displaystyle a}. Make sure you plug in the hypotenuse length for c{\\displaystyle c} and the height for a{\\displaystyle a}. For example, if the first right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10.4566, and a height of 6, your formula will be:62+b2=10.45662{\\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10.4566^{2}} This will give you the length of base of the first right triangle, and the first missing section of the trapezoid’s bottom base. For example:62+b2=10.45662{\\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10.4566^{2}}36+b2=109.3405{\\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=109.3405}b2=109.3405−36{\\displaystyle b^{2}=109.3405-36}b2=73.3405{\\displaystyle b^{2}=73.3405}b2=73.3405{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\\sqrt {73.3405}}}b=8.5639{\\displaystyle b=8.5639}So, the base of the triangle, and the first missing section of the bottom base of the trapezoid, is about 8.5639 cm. Use the Pythagorean Theorem formula (a2+b2=c2{\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}) to do this. Plug in the length of the hypotenuse for c{\\displaystyle c}, and the height for a{\\displaystyle a}. Solving for b{\\displaystyle b} will give you the length of the second missing section of the trapezoid’s bottom base. For example, if the second right triangle has a hypotenuse of 8.4854, and a height of 6, you would calculate:62+b2=8.48542{\\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=8.4854^{2}}36+b2=72{\\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=72}b2=72−36{\\displaystyle b^{2}=72-36}b2=36{\\displaystyle b^{2}=36}b2=36{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\\sqrt {36}}}b=6{\\displaystyle b=6}So, the base of the second triangle, and the second missing section of the bottom base of the trapezoid, is 6 cm. The perimeter of any polygon is the sum of all sides: P=T+B+L+R{\\displaystyle P=T+B+L+R}. For the bottom base, you will add the bottom side of the rectangle, plus the bases of the two triangles. For example, 6+(8.5639+6+6)+10.4566+8.4854=45.5059{\\displaystyle 6+(8.5639+6+6)+10.4566+8.4854=45.5059}So, the approximate perimeter of your trapezoid is 45.5059 cm.", "output": "Divisez le trapèze en trois figures simples.

Cholesterol is required by the body to make vitamins, hormones and other chemical transmitters. Researchers have discovered that while certain cholesterol molecules are dangerous to your heart and developing clogged arteries, it is sugar and carbohydrates which set up an inflammatory response in the body that is a significant precursor to atherosclerosis.  While you might be steering clear of saturated fats to reduce your cholesterol level and risk of atherosclerosis and clogged arteries, you will have been making a significant mistake. Eating healthy saturated fats has not been scientifically linked with heart disease and clogged arteries.   However, diets high in fructose, sugar-filled low-fat food options, and whole grain wheat have been linked to dyslipidemia creating clogged arteries. Fructose can be found in beverages, fruits, jelly, jams and other pre-sweetened food. Carbohydrates are metabolized into sugars in the body and will also increase the inflammatory response. Large amounts of sugar, fructose, and carbohydrates will increase your risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of clogged arteries. This includes only drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. . The exact toxic components in tobacco which trigger atherosclerosis and clogged arteries is not known, but researchers do know that smoking is a primary risk for inflammation, thrombosis and the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, all of which contribute to clogged arteries. Increased weight increases your risk of diabetes. Diabetes, in turn, increases your risk of clogged arteries. A lack of physical exercise is one of the factors that predict 90% of the risk of heart attacks in men and 94% of the risk in women. Heart disease and heart attacks are just two of the results of clogged arteries. Another contributing factor may be your levels of stress. Just remember to relax and take breaks that will help you to unwind. While taking your blood pressure won't tell you how bad you cholesterol is, it can most definitely be an indicator in whether or not you should be concerned. Your doctor may prescribe a drug called a statin to reduce the buildup of plaque in  your arteries. They cause your body to stop producing cholesterol in the hope that it will instead absorb the existing cholesterol that is built up in you arteries.  Statins are not for everyone, but if you have diabetes, already have heart disease, have high levels of cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher LDL cholesterol), or a high 10-year risk of heart attack, your doctor may recommend you try it.  Statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altoprev), pitavastatin (Livalo), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor).", "output": "Comprenez les causes sous-jacentes de cette maladie.

Sometimes they will give you a valid point and sometimes it won't make sense. As long as you do it in a mature fashion, most parents will be happy to give you reasons. Ask them their concerns and try to address them. This may change their minds if you have a convincing rebuttal. If you can find out why they said no, you can find a way to remove that factor or say it in a way that they will agree to. For example, if you cannot have a phone because they do not think you are old enough, then show them how mature you can be. Pinpointing the reason makes it a lot easier to get to the crux of the issue. Parents will inevitably take your history of behavior into consideration. Start getting good grades (if you aren't already), do chores around the house without them asking you, and stay out of trouble. Make sure they know that you're responsible enough to get or do that specific thing you're asking about. As mentioned previously, sometimes you may have to put in the time. A couple of days of being on good behavior might not be convincing, but a few weeks? That could do the trick. If you remain patient and diligent, they may see that you're ready for this new responsibility. Don't make it obvious that you're upset. Be kind to them and act as you normally would. They may act like they don't care, but they are smiling inside and it will help you in the long run. It can also start making them feel a little guilty, which may not be a bad thing in this situation. The kinder you are, the more they'll feel bad they said no, which could lead to a change of heart. Sometimes, parents respond better to having an argument written out. Write a convincing and persuading letter that explains to your parents why you deserve what you're trying to get. This looks professional and your parents will be impressed at the mature way you're handling the situation. Make sure it's handwritten and presented nicely. They'll see how much work you put into it and how much it means to you. It's a good start point for showing how much work you're willing to put in later, too. If you put this much work into a letter, maybe you will take care of Fluffy, pick up her poo, and take her for walks when she needs them. If one method of persuasion isn't working, try switching arguments. Don't use the same material over and over again. Showing them that you have lots of great reasons about why you should have what you're trying to get. For example, let's say you're asking for a phone and you started with the logical argument that it's safe – if you ever got in trouble, you could call them. It didn't work, so now you need to switch it up. You could talk about how you need a phone to make friends at school, to get a job or volunteer position, or even that there's a special deal going on right now where you can get one really cheaply. What do you think would work for them? Sometimes you have to simply let a decision be for the moment. Simply say, \"Okay, thanks for discussing it with me\" and walk away. You can try again at another time. Keep showing that you are responsible and your parents might change their minds. After all, you get older and more mature every day. You should broach the topic at a later date, but don't be too rushed with it. If your parents say that you'll talk about it after Christmas, for example, wait until a week or so after Christmas. Respect their wishes and they'll be more likely to respect (and grant) yours. If you want a dog and they say, no way, that thing is way too big and expensive, keep your cool.

By and large, delays are understandably hard to avoid (such as unforeseen traffic issues) and are forgiven by guests who came on time. That being said, here are a few things you can do to do your best to keep it from happening:   Ensure that invitations are clear as to the time of the event and if requesting an RSVP, ensure that the time is confirmed. Communicate with (via your contact sheet) the MC, relevant guests (often the leaders of the party members), entertainers and kitchen staff as soon as you're aware of an issue you cannot resolve easily.  Should the delayed guests be the focus (such as the bride and groom), the usual methods are: Contact the delayed guest/s directly to check for an estimation. Advise the kitchen immediately of all developments so they can slow down or speed up to keep time. Refrain from making it known publicly that the event is being delayed because of certain guests (because the party will work that out on their own), but advise key hosts or members of the party that you have been made aware of the fact. Let them know what you intend to do, but allow the hosts to make a suggestion as they know the members of their party and what would be appropriate in the context. Maintain careful watch on the time in relation to speeches. If key guests are late, serve an additional appetizer (first course) and/or beverage early as this will prevent guests who came on time from becoming bored and will keep them occupied. For guests that are going to be delayed for more than is reasonable or possible (such as when serving food that simply cannot wait, such as souffles), start the event as planned and when the delayed guests arrive, start them at the next course of a meal (even if this is dessert). Organise an additional dance, game, speech or other form of entertainment (especially music), and ensure extra distractions, such as group or party photographs are done until they arrive and this back-up strategy should be considered the day in advance. For guests deliberately arriving late, it should be seen as that guest's choice, not your fault as manager, so your duty is first to the guests that are already present and to ensure they're looked after. In a nutshell, act as if there is no problem and carry on regardless. This one is rare if you have planned things carefully, however accidents do happen (such as a guest or young child making a mess of a food table, or an accident in the kitchen). Early on you should be aware of the type of guests so you can take into account when and where food is displayed (such as for a buffet) and where such guests are seated.   Any spillage for safety reasons must be cleaned up immediately, even if it means removing a red carpet or desired décor and furniture to be able to do so. If it is impossible to hide a stain without affecting the appearance or the integrity of the item (such as an antique), then removal is wise. If you have a spare, then use that; if not, move the existing furniture or décor subtly so it does not feel missing. A soft rope barrier, curtain or screen is recommended whenever you need to hide the food area (such as a buffet with chafing dishes, or when organising a \"reveal\" of the next course), as certain guests may feel that if food is in the dining area, it is free-for-all, when they want -- which is not always the case. Shuffle the menu. If part of a dish is not possible to include (such as a side dish that was burnt), either exclude it altogether, find an alternative, reduce the portion sizes to stretch foods, but increase portions of other foods to balance. Advise table hosts as required. Unexpected vegetarians, teetotallers, those with food allergies, religious or special diets –– no surprise should ever occur with proper planning –– but guests occasionally do bring along additional family members, partners or close friends without advising you, especially if it's not a strict invitation-only event. This is usually easily resolved. Keep a headcount as guests arrive and when they arrive at the door, ask if there are any food requirements and advise the kitchen and service staff immediately. For large unexpected groups that are not gatecrashers, send a team member to the kitchen to take stock and, if necessary, drive out to collect more supplies. Kitchens typically over-cater to cover for accidents and more often there are more cancellations than unexpected guests. Limited portions can be stretched when you provide additional fillers, such as bread rolls, salad or vegetable portions, ingredients for which can be quickly sourced from local supermarkets. It's wise to remember that many managers have made serious errors in underestimating the intelligence or forgetting the needs and desires of children at events, as they have the same needs and wants as adults - to have a good time and not be bored. Remember that their parents are also often offended if the event does not cater for their children. In practice, it is best to request an RSVP for every child that may come.   Young children (under 10) are best given food or snacks early as many dinner events have the meals start as late as 8pm, which is far later than most children are used to. Food provided should be fun and healthy but as special as the adult menu as parents appreciate special touches for their children - it makes their job easier so they can have fun as guests in their own right. Over 10's usually are fine to be served adult food and portions, even if they don't eat all of it, but offer the children's menu to them (with their parent's permission) if they don't seem keen on the options. It has also been known for young adults 13-18 to often request the same food as youngsters, such as a hamburger and fries as opposed to more formal restaurant food and it has been a frequently used trick to re-brand the children's menu as an \"Alternative Menu\" for this age group of guests. It is very wise to play safe and discuss with key guests about your plans to keep the young and old engaged, well in advance of the date. A discrete area should be provided for mothers with young children for their needs such as toilet/bathroom breaks, breastfeeding (etc.), and a place for very young children to sleep in if they are tired. Ideally this would never happen, but it does –– family or corporate events both. Politics and drama often come out at events that, as an outsider, you would not be always aware of. Prepare yourself.   Ask the client or key guests before the event of the likelihood of such issues, or with selected hosting guests if it is not appropriate to discuss these issues with the key guests, so that way you can ensure that people are seated in places that will not cause issue. Enlist service staff or key-guests to act as unofficial monitors, to keep an eye out for issues and to step in when required. Strictly speaking, your duty is to ensure the event is smoothly run, but only where it is appropriate, and to stay out of issues that are a private concern. Therefore, you should be aware of who within the party are the \"peacemakers\" of the group. As it can be a difficult job to refuse alcohol to an inebriated guest, or to deal with an inebriated guest that inclines towards anger or violence, it is wise to enlist a peacemaker guest and only involve law enforcement when necessary after consulting with the key guests. Even in small events or backyard events when alcohol is often stored in an ice box for guests to serve themselves, it is equally important to be aware. Gatecrashers are difficult. Should it happen, unobtrusively evict them if appropriate - consult your key guests to verify that they're unwelcome. For large scale and rowdy or abusive gatecrashers, your duty is to protect the existing guests where appropriate and to call security or the police if they do not leave after being politely asked to do so by yourself and/or the key guests. Guests often shuffle name cards about at the beginning where they are sitting, so that they end up sitting next to people they want, or at a table they want. It is wise to check with the key guests how far this is permissible according to them. Typically you should have organised table plans in advance and have received approval from the key guests. Should it be that people must be at certain tables, then it is wise to keep people out of the dining room altogether until time. Often the lobby, foyer or bar area serves this purpose and if it is very important due to family issues, it is wise to group people together and move them en masse to the separate tables by each host-guest and service personnel to seat them in their proper order. Sudden, unexpected rain or snow can be common in parts of the world; likewise, a heatwave or a cold front can also can pose a problem. While weather events are not usually an issue if you're indoors, being outside makes things difficult. If bad weather is expected, then consider moving the event location. If the event cannot be relocated or rescheduled, hire a large tent or pavilion (admittedly this can be pricey on short notice). Keeping an eye on weather developments as you go is important; very little can be done to salvage an event affected by weather, so make the best of what you have. Many parts of the world now have insurance policies in the event of severe weather or other problems. If you are in an area which is known for unexpectedly changeable weather, it is recommended to source a quote if there may be a chance the event will have to be re-scheduled as it will at least cover the client the cost of extending hire of equipment, site and service personnel.", "output": "Sachez comment gérer les invités en retard et autres problèmes liés aux invités.

So don’t fret if the cost of tuition for higher education is beyond your means, because a degree isn’t strictly necessary to find employment. At the same time, though, recognize that technical proficiency coupled with a degree will probably make you stand out over other candidates. Whichever route you choose, put all your emphasis on becoming a proficient programmer. Coasting will only leave you ill-equipped for interviews and the job in question. If you decide on college, be wary about specialized degrees in game programming. Expect these to cover all of the many different aspects of game programming in a relatively short amount of time. Favor a major in Computer Science instead if you aren’t already proficient in the subject.  Each aspect of game programming takes a lot of time to master. Studying computer science in depth is more likely to equip you with the necessary skills to tackle each one, even if those skills aren’t directly applied to games during the course of your studies. If you do consider a specialized degree, research the people who are teaching it. Professors who understand the concepts of game programming, but who have never worked in the field themselves, may not be the best people to learn from. Whether you go to school or teach yourself, aim to master at least one computer language. Focus on C++ to increase your chances of being hired, since this is used the most often in game programming. Other languages that are helpful include:  Actionscript Assembly C Java Objective-C Python Swift Remember: the best way to learn how to do something is to actually do it! Once you learn how to code in computer languages, apply your skills. Build a game from the ground up to grow more familiar with the whole process, from start to finish. As you do, you should:  Keep it basic. Don’t worry about revolutionizing games as you know it. To make an analogy, write a simple short story, not James Joyce’s Ulysses. Copy another game if needed. The purpose here is to learn, not to be original. Borrow another game’s concept and build on it if you’re stuck for ideas. Do everything yourself. Don’t rely on using outside vector/math libraries. Make all aspects a DIY project in order to increase your proficiency. Finish it! You want to grow familiar with the whole process, so follow through all the way to the end. Don’t abandon it just because you’ve already finished your favorite aspect of programming. Remember: as a professional game developer, you’ll be part of a team tasked with specific aspects. So as you learn to code and build your own games, decide on which areas you want to concentrate on when hired. Once you do, continue to work on personal projects and place more attention to these areas. Titles and departments may vary from company to company, but generally programming is divided between: artificial intelligence; animation; audio; build systems; engines; gameplay; networking; physics; rendering; tools; and user interface.", "output": "Décidez entre suivre une formation classique et l'autodidacte.

This infringes on your quality time together.  Talk it over with him and set limits one when you can both utilize technology while together.  “We both seem to spend so much time looking at our phones that we miss out on opportunities to spend quality time together.  I’d like to suggest that we set some parameters for when we use technology when we’re together.” Consider banning phones from any meals you eat together.  Put them on the counter, in another room, just make them inaccessible so that you two can talk with one another. Put your phones and tablets on “Do Not Disturb” or “Goodnight Mode” so that neither of you are compelled to check an incoming email or text message after 9 o’clock in the evening. You might want to compromise if your boyfriend’s job is dependent on being available on off hours. For example, many doctors must be on call and available to address patient issues over the telephone on evenings and weekends. Talk to your boyfriend about your schedules and together, decide on days or activities that you’d regularly like to make time to be together.  This doesn’t mean that you should only spend time together on those days, or that you’re even committed to always spending time together according to the schedule, but it does give you a nice foundation with which to work.  You might plan on taco Tuesdays for dinner at a local eatery, Fridays going out for dinner and a movie, Saturdays going bike riding or hiking, and Mondays watching television at home. This will help you establish a foundation, but also help you have the conversation about how much time you feel each of you should make for the other. While you two are talking about how much time you expect one another to make for the relationship, also come up with a code word that either of you can say if you’re uncomfortable with your partner’s behavior.  Code words are discreet, quick, simple, and keep the conversation between the two of you.  This is especially effective if one of you breaks the technology rules that you agree on. This is also handy if you’re in a group setting and he starts making plans with someone else for a time that you already agreed to spend together. Keep your code word simple, but also not an everyday word.  You don’t want it to be so common that you both get confused.  For example, “seltzer water” or “lamp shade” or “Professor Xavier” are simple but also unique enough that they won’t come up in everyday conversation, typically. You and your boyfriend may have different schedules or responsibilities that prevent you from seeing one another as much as you like.  This is a great opportunity to utilize technology, such as text messages, social media, or even video chat.  Making time for one another doesn’t have to be only in person.

The gauge of a needle is inversely proportional to its diameter, so the lower the gauge, the bigger the needle. For instance, a calf's skin is thinner than that of an adult cow, so a finer and higher gauge needle can be used instead. Use the finest gauge possible to make sure that the cow feels as little pain as possible, but not so fine that risk of breaking the needle is significant.  To give an injection to a calf weighing less than 500 pounds, an 18-20 gauge (g) needle with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) length is ideal. For larger animals weighing over 500 pounds, you will need a 16-18 g needle with of 1 ½ inch length. Breed can also play a part on determining needle gauge. Black Angus cattle tend to have thinner hides than Herefords, for instance, so you won't need a 16 g needle to pierce the thinner hide of an Angus cow, versus the thicker one of a Hereford. You will need a shorter needle for subcutaneous injections, and a longer needle for intramuscular and intravenous injections.  You won't need a needle longer than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm), for SQ injections because you only need to penetrate the skin. For IM and IV injections, needles that are around 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) or more are best. It is acceptable to use the same needle for up to 15 injections as long as it remains sharp and straight. Always change to a new needle when drawing from a different bottle of medication because using the old needle may introduce contamination. Never attempt to straighten a bent or burred needle because it is much more likely to break on you or break off in the process of injection.

You can easily upload your manuscript to the KDP program and begin to sell copies.  Kindle Direct Publishing will accept a variety of file formats when uploading. Kindle uses a Mobi format to output the eBook so that eReaders can read it. But when uploading you can upload your manuscript as an HTML, Doc/Docx, RTF, Mobi, or ePub. Use can use a program like Calibre to convert your manuscript to Mobi or ePub before uploading if you wish.  This sometimes makes the uploading easier and keeps any images or forms in your book intact. In addition to the file type that you upload your manuscript in, you’ll also have to decide if you want a standard eBook format or a fixed layout format.   Standard formats are typically ePub and Mobi files. These formats allow readers to adjust the size of the text in an eReader. Note that in this form, there isn’t a set pagination as the size of the text will adjust how many words appear on a page. This format is good for text-heavy books. Fixed layouts are better used in comics, children’s books, and books with a lot of pictures and graphs. This format preserves the qualities of a printed page. It’s more like looking at photos of a page on an eReader than reading “living” text. Amazon has a few eBook publishing options. The standard is the KDP service. There’s also KDP Select. This is the “premium” version of Kindle Direct Publishing. Though both are free to upload.  The standard KDP service allows you to upload your book to Amazon’s service for free. There’s no charge to upload the file. Author’s will receive about 30-35% of royalties while Amazon keeps the rest. The KDP Select service gives Amazon an exclusive on your digital book for 90 days, meaning you can’t upload it anywhere else. You do receive closer to 70% of royalties. Amazon will also market your book for you through the Prime member’s lending library. You also have the option to make your book free or discounted for five days. During this time, it will show up on Amazon’s sales pages. Once you’ve decided on which option you like best, sign up to publish through the “independently publish with us” link at the bottom of Amazon’s homepage.   You can sign in with your Amazon account. You will have to read and agree to the terms of service. Once completed you will have a publishing account. Follow the uploading steps to add a title and enter your book’s details. The details allow you to specify if the book is part of series, book type, pricing, etc. You can add you ISBN code if you have one. But it is not needed with Amazon. Select your category. Amazon encourages you to add up to two categories to get better exposure. Search for books like yours and see which categories these books have used. You can also add up to seven keywords to make your book show up better in a search. Finally, upload your cover.  Then you’re ready to upload. When you’re ready, click “Browse for book” to find the copy of your manuscript on your computer. Then click “Upload”.  Amazon allows you to choose if you want to enable digital rights management (DRM) or not. Enabling DRM makes it harder for others to copy and share your work without you earning payment. For example, someone can’t copy the file and download it to another eReader. You most likely won’t lose any money or sales for not adding DRM, however. Once you upload your book will have the option to use the “Online Previewer” link to see how your book will look.  Amazon does a pretty good job of retaining your book’s formatting, especially if you already had the book in a correct format, like Mobi. You can see how your book will look on a variety of devices from a Kindle to an iPhone to a browser window. You should look over your book in all these options to make sure everything is how you want it. You will now have the option to price your book. Amazon will also give you an option for royalty percentage. Your options are usually 35% or 70%.  Choosing the 70% makes your book fall under the KDP Select option. You get the marketing benefits and ability to discount your book for a time. But, you aren’t allowed to upload it, or sell it anywhere else for 90 days. If you price your book below $2.99 USD, Amazon will only give you the 35% option. Choosing to take the higher royalty also means that Amazon deducts a small “delivery fee”. This fee is usually 15 cents per megabyte. Most books with little to no graphics and roughly 100,000 words don’t go over 1 MB. There’s no charge if you take the smaller royalty.

You don't want to overdo anything or endanger your health, and your doctor may be able to refer you to a qualified trainer or physical therapist. Though you can do some physical activities on your own to reverse muscle atrophy's effects, it is always best to have a qualified instructor or trainer to ensure that you are on the right track. She will start out by assessing your capabilities and guide you through specific exercises to build muscle in the atrophied areas. She can also gauge your progress and adjust the exercise routine as needed. Since many people with atrophied muscles are beginning exercise again after a long break from physical activity, it's important to start slowly. Remember, your body is not as strong as it was prior to atrophy. Swimming and water exercises are often recommended for patients who are trying to recover from muscle atrophy because this form of exercise can dull muscle pain, quickly tone atrophied muscles, rebuild muscle memory, and relax sore muscles. While it's best to work with an expert, here are a few basic steps to get you started: With water at hip- to waist-height, try walking around the pool for 10 minutes. This workout is low-risk and helps develop the muscles in the lower part of your body.  As you progress, increase the time interval and the depth of the water. You can also use paddles or water barbells for more resistance. These tools will help work your core and upper body. Try a knee lift by positioning your back against the pool wall, and placing both feet flat on the bottom of the pool. Then, lift a knee up as if you are marching in place. When your knee is at hip height, extend it outward.  Keep doing this for ten repetitions, before switching to the other leg. As you progress, try doing additional sets for each leg. Face the pool wall with your arms resting on the deck of the pool and shoulder-width apart. Use your hands to raise your body up out of the water so you are about halfway out of the pool. Hold the position for a few seconds and then slowly lower yourself back in the pool. For an easier version, place your hands on the pool deck so they are shoulder-width apart. As you bend your elbows, lean your chest toward the wall of the pool. If you feel proficient doing exercises in the water, add some body-weight exercises while on dry land.  A beginner can start with eight to twelve repetitions of the exercise moves mentioned below. These exercises target the major muscle groups. Perform this routine three times per week to build up atrophied muscles. To perform a squat, stand straight and put both hands forward. Slowly and carefully bend your knees, as if sitting in an imaginary chair. Hold this position for a few seconds before going back to the starting position. Keep your weight on your heels and do not allow your knees to go past your toes. To perform lunges, stand up straight with your hands on your hips. Pull your abdominal muscles in.  Take a large step forward with your right foot. Keep your back straight while moving forward. Your heel should be raised while the tip of the toe is pressing against the floor. Bend both knees at the same time until they both form a 90 degree angle. You can check your position at the mirror to know if you are doing it right. Put your heel down and push upwards to stand. Return to the starting position and do all of the above with the left leg. Remember that your body should not be slouching forward. To do a triceps dip, prepare a strong bench or a secured chair. Sit on the bench or chair and place your hands shoulder-width apart along the edge.  Slowly slide your butt off the seat with your legs extended in front of you. Straighten your arms to keep tension on the triceps. Bend your elbows carefully while keeping your back close to the bench. Upon completing this part, press down on the bench to straighten your arms. For a basic ab crunch, lie on your back on a mat or a carpeted surface. Bend your knees and make sure that your feet are flat on the floor.  You can cross your arms in front of your chest or place your hands behind your neck or head. Try to pull your shoulders towards the ceiling by making use of the force from your abdominal muscles. Hold the “crunched” position for a few seconds, then lie back down and repeat. Make use of resistance tools such as resistance bands or weight machines to help you with your form. You should only move on to these exercises once you can successfully perform the body-weight exercises indicated above. It's also a good idea to research specific resistance exercises that target the affected area.  Bench presses can be done with resistance bands. Lay down on a bench and push forward while gripping the bands like you are lifting barbells. Start with lighter-weight bands. If you feel comfortable with the current weight, fold it lengthwise to increase the resistance. Once you feel comfortable, you can move on to heavier-weight bands. In addition to the other exercises described in this article, cardio exercise is a good way to build up atrophied muscles. Try establishing a regular walking or cardio routine. Start with ten to fifteen minutes of continuous walking per day. Gradually increase your speed and try to take a 30-minute walk or jog daily. After each workout, stretch your muscles to increase their range of motion. Do five to ten minutes of stretching after each workout. You can also perform a separate stretching session.  Make sure to perform stretches that target all of the major muscles, and hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. Begin with stretching your back and your upper body. Next move on to stretches for your neck, forearms, wrists and triceps. Do not forget your chest, buttocks and groin area before moving to your thighs. Lastly, perform stretches for instep and hamstrings. Here are some specific stretching exercises for different parts of the body:  Neck stretching: Incline your head forward then stretch your neck to the left, right, back and forward. Do not roll your head from side to side as this practice is dangerous. Shoulder stretching: Place your left arm on your chest. Grab the forearm with the opposite arm. Pull it until you feel that your shoulder is being stretched. Push the arm you are stretching in the opposite direction to contract the muscles. Do the same steps for the right arm. Triceps stretching: Start with raising your right arm. Bend the right elbow and reach down behind your head and between the shoulder blades. Make use of the left arm to reach and grab the right elbow. Lastly, pull your elbow toward your head. Wrist stretching: Simply hold your arm out and slightly pull back your hand with the opposite hand. Do this repetitively. Hamstrings stretching: Start in a cross-legged sitting position. Put one leg out. Attempt to reach and hold the foot for a few seconds. Go back to the starting position and do the same thing with the other leg. Lower back stretch: Lie down on your back. Bring one leg up to chest level. Do the same with the other leg. Leg stretching: Lie down on your back and extend both legs in the air. Grab the back of your thighs and pull the legs toward your face.", "output": "Consultez un professionnel avant d'entamer un programme sportif.

Some even have extra items embedded inside, such as flower petals and glitter. Other bath bombs contain additional oils and butters that are good for your skin, such as almond oil and cocoa butter. Find a bath bomb whose color and smell appear to you the most; if you have dry skin, then look for one with additional oils and butters for extra moisture. Here are some things you can expect to find in a bath bomb:  Essential oils such as lavender, chamomile, and rose. These not only make the bath bomb smell nice, but they can also help you feel relaxed or more awake. Skin softening and nourishing oils and butters, such as almond oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and cocoa butter. These are great for dry skin! Fun additives such as glitter and flower petals will float on top of the bath water. They are for aesthetic purposes and can help enhance the mood. Salts and powdered clays and herbs are also often found in a bath bomb. They help soften, moisturize, and nourish your skin. Some bath bombs include flower petals, which can get stuck in the tub after you drain the water out. You can prevent this from happening by putting the bath bomb inside a small cloth bag or a nylon stocking. The detergents, fragrances, and oils will pass through the fabric and enhance the bath water, but the petals will remain inside the bag or nylon stocking. Once the bath is over, all you have to do is empty out the bag or recycle it. Bath bombs are expensive, but you can make yours last longer by cutting it in half using a serrated knife. You will use one of the halves for your bath, and save the other half for another bath. If you choose to only use half of your bath bomb, be sure to store the other half properly by wrapping it in plastic wrap and keeping it in a dry location. You can also store you bath bomb in an air-tight container, such as a mason jar. Make sure that the bath bomb is dry; and moisture will cause it to start to fizz. You are making this bath for yourself, so make sure that it is comfortable for you. Make the water as deep or as shallow as you like, and use a temperature that is not too hot and not too cold for you. Once you have filled the tub to your liking, turn the water off. As soon as the bath bomb enters the water, it will start to bubble and fizz. Over time, the bath bomb will start to break apart and dissolve, thus allowing all the beneficial oils, salts, and butters to be released into the bath water. You can enter the tub while the bath bomb is still fizzing, or you can wait until it has finished. Get into a comfortable position. You can close your eyes and relax, meditate, or even read a book. The bath bomb will dissolve, and fill the water with fragrant essential oils, nourishing and moisturizing butters and oils, and additional items, such as flower petals, glitter, and color. After a while, the water will start to naturally cool down. At this point, you can leave the bathtub and drain the water. Do not stay in the water too long, or your skin will turn pruney and wrinkly! You do not have to rinse off after using a bath bomb, but if you used a colored bath bomb or one with glitter in it, you may consider doing so. Simply drain the bathtub, then take a shower and rinse the oils and butters off your skin. You may use a loofah and shower gel as well, if you wish. Some bath bombs use dyes that may stain your tub. The dyes will be easier to clean off while they are still damp. Use a bathtub cleaning sponge or brush and scrub the dye residue away.

They reduce the symptoms of stress, and can help prevent relapses of ASD. They can also help treat the secondary effects of mental illness like insomnia, fatigue, and hypertension. When you seek psychological help for ASD, your therapist will probably teach you several relaxation exercises. It is usually a part of cognitive behavioral therapy. A common and powerful tool for reducing stress is deep breathing. By using the right techniques, you can effectively lower your stress level and help avoid future problems.  Take breaths from your abdomen, not your chest. This will pull more oxygen into your body and help you relax. When breathing, place your hand on your stomach to make sure your abdomen rises and falls when you breathe. If it doesn't, you aren't breathing deeply enough. Sit up with your back straight. Alternatively, you could lie on the floor too. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Take in as much air as you can, and then exhale until your lungs are completely empty. Like deep breathing, meditation helps release stress from the body and lets the you achieve a state of relaxation. Regular meditation can help improve your mental and physical health by reducing your levels of stress and anxiety.  In this process, the person shifts to a quiet place, concentrates on a single sound, and allows his or her mind to turn away from all concerns and thoughts of daily life. Select a quiet place, sit comfortably, clear all thoughts out of your mind and concentrate on the image of a candle, or a word like “relax”. Do this for 15 to 30 minutes daily. People with good support networks are less susceptible to episodes and relapses of mental illness. In addition to family and friends, you can reach out to support groups for help and camaraderie.  Share your issues with those close to you. Don't bottle up your feelings. Telling your family and friends what you're feeling is very important for building a support network. They can't help you if they don't know what's going on. You can also reach out and find a support group in your area that specializes in your specific illness. Doing a quick internet search will probably help you find a group close to you. Keeping a journal has been shown to help reduce stress and anxiety. It is a liberating experience to get all of your feelings out, and most treatment programs for mental illness involve writing in a journal. Commit to writing for a few minutes every day to benefit your mental health.  When you write, really try to reflect on what's troubling you. First write what triggered your stress, then how you responded to it. What were your feeling sor thoughts when you started to feel stressed?  Analyze your interpretation of the event. Identify if you are entering a negative though pattern. Then try to re-balance your interpretation in a way that is more positive and avoids catastrophic thinking.", "output": "Soulagez votre stress avec des techniques de relaxation.

To simply access the battery, pop open the car hood and locate the battery. It’s typically on the front-left side of the engine block. Visually inspect the general condition of your car battery. If the battery is not cracked or leaking battery acid, you can go ahead and start cleaning. If your battery case has cracks, you should replace the entire battery. Visit a local auto-parts store and purchase a battery there. Lift up and to the sides the plastic covers on top of the battery. This will reveal the terminal/clamp interface. Examine the battery cables and clamps for excess wear or corrosion. Corrosion appears as a white, ashy deposit around one or both battery posts. If the cables and clamps are lightly corroded or have just a little buildup, follow the instructions below on how to clean them. If the damage is extensive, you may want to completely replace the cables and clamps to avoid future problems. Before cleaning the battery, you’ll need to disconnect the battery. To do this, loosen the nuts on the clamps using a wrench. Once loosened, remove the negative clamp, marked with a “-” first. Only after the negative clamp is removed, remove the positive clamp, marked with a “+”.  The clamps may prove difficult to remove, especially if there is a lot of corrosion. You may need to use pliers to remove them. If you do need to use pliers be careful not to touch the tool to the car frame (or anything else metal) and the battery while working. Doing so will short out the battery. Combine 2–3 tablespoons (30–44 mL) of baking soda with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of distilled water in a small bowl. Stir the ingredients together with a spoon to make a thick paste. Keep stirring until all of the bits of baking soda are fully dissolved in the water. Baking soda is alkaline, which means that it’s capable of neutralizing corrosion from battery acid. Dip an old toothbrush or a lightly dampened rag into the baking soda paste. Rub the paste onto the corroded or dirty parts of your car’s battery. Once the baking soda is applied, you will see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion. Give the baking soda mix at least 5–10 minutes to soak in and loosen the corrosion. Be careful while you’re applying the paste. Although baking soda is generally safe, you should take care not to get it on other car components. If your battery terminals have heavy deposits, use the sharper edge of a used butter knife to scrape them off. Hold the knife’s blade at a 45-degree angle and press it downward along the surface of the battery to chip off bits of corrosion. After you have removed the major deposits, use a wire brush or steel wool to remove any remaining deposits.  Wear vinyl dishwashing gloves while cleaning the terminals, especially if you’re scrubbing off corrosion with steel wool. Your hands will be coming in direct contact with potentially caustic agents, and vinyl gloves are the best protection.  There are special “battery post” and “battery clamp” brushes available at most auto parts stores, but these are not necessary in most cases. A general steel brush works fine. When the baking soda mixture stops foaming and there are no major deposits left to be scraped off, you can go ahead and rinse all of the corrosion dust and drying baking soda off of the battery. Pour about 2 cups (470 mL) of distilled water over the battery and the positive and negative terminals.  Be careful not to rinse the baking soda paste into the battery vents, as the baking soda can neutralize the battery’s acid and shorten the battery’s life. The vents are located on the sides of the battery and are connected to long vent tubes that direct harmful gases away from the vehicle’s cabin. Dry the entire battery thoroughly before reconnecting it to your vehicle. Make sure that the terminals are completely dry by rubbing the dry rag over them 2-3 times. Be sure to use a rag that doesn’t have any grease or oil on it! Don’t use paper towels for this step. The paper will shred, leaving you with bits of paper towel stuck to your battery terminals. Dip 2 fingers into a jar of petroleum jelly and smear a thin layer across both the positive and negative terminals. Make sure your vinyl gloves are still on while you do this. Applying hydrophobic petroleum jelly to the now cleaned terminals will prevent corrosion from occurring again in the future. If you don’t already have petroleum jelly at your home, purchase some at a drugstore or pharmacy. To complete the cleaning, you need to reattach the clamps that you removed earlier to secure the battery in place and restore the electrical connection. Reattach the positive clamp to the battery first by tightening it with a wrench. Once it’s firmly in place, then you can attach the negative clamp to the negative terminal on the battery. Use a wrench to tighten that clamp in place as well. Once the clamps are on, replace the rubber or plastic shields covering the clamp/terminal junction.", "output": "Soulevez le capot de la voiture.

The longer you save and invest, the more likely you are to reach your goals and build sizable wealth.   You can set aside more money to invest over a long period of time than over a short one. That may seem obvious, but many people don’t fully appreciate how powerful the effect of time can be on accumulating wealth. For example, if you can afford to save $50 per month, starting at age 5 (assuming someone begins setting aside money for you), by age 65 you will have saved $36,000. ($50 per month x 12 months per year x 60 years) or ($50 x 12 x 60 = $36,000.) That doesn't include any earnings on the dollars you invest. If you were to begin saving at age 50, you'd have to save $200 a month in order to arrive at that same $36,000 by age 65 ($200 x 12 x 15 years). If you start investing early, you have more time to make up for any investment losses that will occur in some years. Investors that start later have less time to make up for any investment losses. Time will permit your investments to rebound in value. The Standard and Poor's (S and P) 500 is an index of 500 large stocks. From 1928 to 2014, the average annual return has been about 10%. While there have been negative returns in some years, people who invest over the long term have profited from owning this index of stocks. The frequency of your contributions (e.g. weekly, monthly, or yearly) has an important impact on your long-term success. If you have trouble remembering to add to your savings account, try setting up an automatic monthly transfer from your checking account (e.g., $100 per month).  Savings is the process of moving funds into a separate bank account. You segregate money between a savings account and a personal checking account. This process helps ensure that you don’t spend the amount you intend to save. You can then invest your savings account balance in CDs, stocks, bonds, or other types of investments. Saving money more frequently means you can add less each time you contribute. This can make it easier to fit each investment into your personal budget. For example, starting at age 5, you could save $12.50 per week (assuming a 4–week month). You could also save $50 per month or $600 per year. The total you’re investing is the same, but it’s easier to save smaller amounts more often. Once your funds are in savings, move the funds into an investment as soon as possible. You'll earn a higher rate of return from an investment. When you move money from savings into an investment vehicle, take advantage of compounding.  Compounding will make your investments grow faster, like a snowball rolling downhill. The longer it rolls, the faster it grows. Compounding works faster if you invest more frequently.   When you compound your investments, you are earning “interest on interest.” Over time, you earn interest on both your original investment and on the prior interest you earned. The index value on any investment may be higher or lower in any given year. Over time, however, the index has generated average return of about 10% per year. You can use dollar cost averaging to benefit from short-term declines in an investment’s value.   When you invest using dollar cost averaging, you invest the same dollar amount each month. Dollar cost averaging is typically used with stock and mutual fund investing. Both of those investments are purchased in shares (stock shares or mutual fund shares). If the share price goes down, you end up buying more shares. Say, for example, that you invest $500 each month. If the share price is $50, you’ll buy 10 shares. Assume that the share price goes down to $25. The next time you invest $500, you’ll purchase 20 shares. Dollar cost averaging may reduce your cost per share. As the share price increases over time, a lower cost per share increases your profit. If you invest in bonds, compounding is the multiplying effect of interest on interest. For stocks, compounding is generating earnings on your prior dividends. In both cases, you should reinvest any interest or dividends your investments earn.  Frequency and time are also important. A greater frequency of compounding means you receive and reinvest earnings more often. The more often this occurs and the longer you let it continue, the more powerful the effect.   For example, let's say at age 25 you start saving $100 per month, and you earn 6% interest. By age 65, you will have invested $48,000. That money would actually grow to nearly $200,000, however, if you compounded the interest monthly over that 40-year period.  In contrast, let's say you wait to start saving until you are 40, but decide to save $200 a month at the same 6% interest rate. By age 65, you will have invested $60,000. However, you will not have as much time for your interest to compound each month. The result is that you will have only $138,600 saved for retirement (rather than the approximate $200,000 in the earlier example). You will have saved more of your money but end up with less after compounding.", "output": "Commencez tôt. Ajoutez régulièrement de l'argent à vos économies.

You may need to experiment with the weight to make sure that the trap sinks all the way to the bottom – but 1-5 pounds should do the trick. Use the same weight size that you used on the bottom, or something slightly lighter. This will keep the trap balanced at the bottom of the stream. If only the bottom is weighted, the opening of the trap may get stuck in the mud. Unscrew the top cap, and drop the bait into the chamber. When you've set the bait, screw the top cap back on so that the crawfish cannot escape. Use fish to mimic the natural diet of the crawfish. Many Swedish fishermen use sunfish, shiners, and herring; Cajun fishermen traditionally use gizzard shad and pogies; West Coast fishermen often use salmon heads and other oily fish. If possible, use fish caught in the same body of water where you're trying to catch the crawfish.

If your puppy or dog is older than this and hasn't been to the veterinarian yet, now is the time to schedule an appointment for an examination and to start or update vaccinations. This is important for your dog's health.  Make sure you vaccinate your dog against rabies, as this deadly disease can be caught by humans. It is a legal requirement of many states to vaccinate against rabies. For the first vet visit, you actually need to schedule two appointments. The first appointment will be an initial vaccination, followed in three to four weeks (depending on your vet's recommendations) by a booster vaccine. This will ensure that your puppy's immune system is “primed” to fight any invading diseases.  The veterinarian will discuss vaccines required in your area. The basic vaccines include distemper, rabies, and possibly Lyme vaccine. Vaccines are generally boostered at intervals of every year or every other year. Veterinary clinics will usually send you a reminder in the mail or via e-mail a few weeks prior to the due date for routine vaccinations after the first one is given. Another important health concern is heartworm disease. This nasty pest is spread by mosquitoes and lives in dog's hearts, causing misery and ill health. Your dog will need a test to make sure it is free from this pest.  Heartworm preventative should also be started as soon as possible to prevent this disease if your dog is given the all-clear. This is either a shot that will protect your dog for up to six months, or a monthly heartworm pill that your dog eats. If your dog tests positive for heartworm, the veterinarian will discuss treatment options which generally consists of further blood work, heart X-rays, and a (painful) treatment consisting of shots of a harsh medication and oral medication. Your veterinarian will also recommend routine de-worming for your dog. Puppies generally will be given a deworming treatment at their vaccination appointments to make sure they are free of roundworms and hookworms, two common intestinal pests of puppies. Your dog's stool will be examined at follow-up vaccination appointments to make sure your dog is free from intestinal parasites. This operation helps control dog overpopulation and prevents some problems: male dog fighting, reproductive tract cancers, and stops male dog roaming.  However, roaming can be resolved through less invasive means such as a fence, and dog aggression can be eliminated through training and making your dog feel more secure. Alternative options are available, too, such as Vasectomy, Neutering, Tubal Ligation and Ovary-Sparing Spay (OSS).

Narcissistic personality disorder is relatively rare with prevalence ranging from 0% to 6.2% in community samples. Of those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, 50-75% are male.  The symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder include a large sense of self importance, the need for recognition or admiration, the need to exaggerate achievements or talents, being envious of others or believing others envy you, and expecting special favors from those around you. People with narcissistic personality disorder tend to think of the world solely in terms of themselves and their own needs.  Basic criticism or setbacks can cause major episodes of depression in those suffering narcissistic personality disorder. This is, in fact, often what first prompts those suffering from the disorder to seek help. However, you do not have to wait that long. If you're worried you may show symptoms of narcissism, make an appointment with a therapist. , including Asperger Syndrome. Autistic people often have difficulty understanding social cues and figuring out how to respond. They tend to be straightforward and honest, which can accidentally come off as insensitive.  You may be autistic if you care deeply about others' feelings, and hate to see them get upset, but are called insensitive. The \"insensitivity\" in many autistic people is called by cluelessness, overwhelm, and misunderstanding, not by lack of caring.  Other autism symptoms include strong emotions, stimming (unusual fidgeting), dislike of eye contact, sluggishness, passionate special interests, need for routine, and general clumsiness..  While autism is often identified in childhood, it is possible for symptoms to be looked over or hidden, and some people are not diagnosed until teen or adult years. Talk to a therapist if you think you have symptoms of autism. Many personality disorders cause insensitivity to others. Personality disorders are a group of mental illnesses that cause long-term behavioral and thinking patterns that are unhealthy. While nearly all personality disorders can cause some degree of insensitivity, the following are most often associated with a lack of empathy:  Antisocial personality disorder, which involves an inability to distinguish right from wrong, hostility, aggression, violence, a lack of longterm relationships, unnecessary risk taking behavior, and a sense of superiority.  Borderline personality disorder, which involves difficulty regulating emotions or thoughts, frequently engaging in impulsive and reckless behaviors, and an inability to maintain stable relationships longterm.  Schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders are defined by a lack of social relations, delusional thought patterns, and excessive social anxiety. If you feel you may be suffering from any of the above disorders, talk over your concerns with a professional therapist or psychiatrist. While many online questionnaires can tell you if you display symptoms of certain disorders, only a professional can diagnose your properly.

In part for this reason, you should never take steps to help your blood coagulate and clot without professional medical guidance.

While you're waiting, grease your cake pans with butter, baking spray, or vegetable shortening. On top of the greased pan, sprinkle a pinch of flour to create a light dusting. If you'd rather not used greased pans, you can instead line your cake pan with parchment paper. Add the butter and sugar to your mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients together with your mixer on low speed. Continue beating for five to 10 minutes.  As the butter and sugar incorporate, increase the speed to medium, and finally to high for the last minute or two. Creaming the butter and sugar together in this way will create a light and fluffy cake that has plenty of volume, because the process whips air bubbles into the butter. Crack each egg separately into a small bowl and beat it a little before adding it to the flour and sugar mixture. This will give you time to remove any shell pieces, and will prevent the mixture from curdling. Turn the beaters on low and have them running as you add each egg.  You want the eggs at room temperature because a warm egg won’t decrease the final volume of the cake. Continue beating the mixture until all the eggs have been incorporated and the mixture is smooth and yellow. Beat on low until everything is incorporated. Don’t overmix, as this will produce a cake that’s tough instead of fluffy. Once added, beat the mixture on low for about 30 seconds. If there is any unincorporated batter on the sides of the bowl, use the spoon or paddle to scrape it down. Increase the speed to high and continue beating for a minute or two. If you're making more than one cake, divide the batter evenly between the two pans. Use your spoon to wipe the sides of the bowl so you don’t waste any batter. There are a few ways to tell when your cake is ready, and they include when:  The cake springs back when pressed gently with a finger The cake starts pulling away from the sides of the cake pan A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean Place the cake on a wire rack and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes.

You can think of this as the position your wrist takes when you say \"stop\" with your hand. Whether you're typing, eating, or doing some other repetitive movement, you should try to maintain a neutral wrist position as often as you can instead of flexing your wrist. Think of the neutral position as the handshake position -- when you shake someone's hand, you don't have to bend your wrists at all. Carefully monitor your hands to try to maintain this position as much as possible. If you're doing a repetitive activity, whether you're typing or chopping vegetables, take a short break every 10-15 minutes to give your wrists a break. This could mean stretching, performing exercises, or just sitting there without using your wrists. No matter how busy you are, you can always take a 1-2 minute break when needed. Don't let too much time go by without resting your wrists.  If you can, try to switch tasks every 20-40 minutes. Additionally, try to change your position as often as you can. You don't want to get \"stuck\" in one position for too much time. Most people use more force than necessary when performing daily tasks. Whether you're holding on to a mouse, using a pen, or working a cash register, you should try not to squeeze anything too much or to use too much force. Don't punch the keys on your keyboard or push any other buttons with more force than needed to get the job done. This will keep you from putting too much pressure on your wrists. Though the best thing you can do to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome is to take care of your wrists, studies show that maintaining your overall health can help you have healthy wrists. Make sure to eat at least three healthy meals a day, get regular exercise (around 30 minutes a day), to get 7-8 hours of sleep a night, and to do whatever else you have to do to feel both mentally and physically sound. Wrist splints, when worn correctly, can help you maintain a neutral wrist position without causing any discomfort. You can get a relatively inexpensive wrist splint at the local pharmacy (they typically cost around $15-20), or if you want more help, your doctor or physical therapist can recommend or even order more advanced splints. You can wear these while you work to keep you from bending your wrists, and you can also wear them at night to maintain a neutral position while you sleep; a lot of people sleep with bent wrists. NSAIDs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Advil, and they can be used to reduce pain and swelling in your wrists. Though they won't prevent carpal tunnel, they can certainly ease the pain if they are taken from time to time. Don't make a habit of this, though, because these drugs should not be a substitute for other preventative measures. If you're working in a cold environment, you are more likely to develop pain and stiffness in your hands.

However, some equipment is in higher demand than others and you should be aware of high resale value items. The prices for these items may be competitive and you may want to factor resale value when you are buying medical equipment as well.   Popular medical equipment items for resale include:  Wheelchairs Anaesthesia machines Surgical tables Defibrillators Ventilators Infusion and syringe pumps Patient monitors Incubators Infant warmers Surgical microscopes EKG machines Before you can sell your used medical equipment, you will need to clean it up and make it look almost as good as new. If you are selling a used wheelchair, for example, you should use cleaner to wash and clean the chair. You should also wash the wheels and make sure the wheels still work properly. Cleaning the equipment will ensure it is in selling shape and will look appealing in advertisements. It is also easier to assess how used the equipment is when it is clean and looking its best. You may then factor in its level of use in your pricing of the equipment when you sell it. Once you have cleaned up the equipment so it looks its best, you should take four to five good photographs of the equipment at different angles. You can then use these photographs in your advertisements for the equipment.  Use a good digital camera to get several clear shots of the equipment. You may want to have someone use the equipment as you photograph it so you can show that the equipment is in good working condition. Photograph the equipment against a solid white background so it is easy to see the equipment in the images. The images should only show the equipment and no other clutter or items, especially if the other items are not for sale. Use good lighting to it is easy to view the equipment and use a high resolution for the images so they will look good in your online advertisements. When photographing the equipment, it’s important that you also note any damages or issues with the equipment in the advertisement. You should take pictures of any damages on the equipment so you can be completely honest and forthcoming in the ads for the equipment. There are several online sites that allow you to sell used goods for a small fee, such as ebay.com, or craigslist.com, as well as sites that specialize in selling and buying used medical equipment for a small fee, such as medibid.com, usedhm.com, disabledgear.com or dremed.com. You can also search online forums that relate to a certain disability and post equipment that may be useful for individuals with that disability in the forums. This way, you are advertising directly to individuals who may be the most interested in the equipment. Many medical equipment shops will offer cash or store credit for used equipment. You may also be able to sell the equipment on consignment, where you get a percentage of the sale of the equipment. Look up local medical equipment stores in your area and offer your equipment. Most stores will take items based on need and on the condition of the equipment. Some medical equipment shops can also refurbish broken equipment and turn damaged equipment into sellable equipment. This may save your damaged medical equipment from the charity shop or the dump and allow you to still turn a small profit from the equipment. If there are any medical facilities in your area, contact them and offer to sell them your used medical equipment. Medical facilities that are publicly funded may be short on equipment and be willing to purchase equipment from you for a reduced price. It’s a good idea to contact the facilities before you bring any equipment to their door, as you do not want to hail large equipment there only be told they are not interested. Be sure to send the facilities photographs and descriptions of each item or piece of equipment so they have a good sense of the condition of the equipment. It may take time to become a reseller who specializes in medical equipment, as you will need to accumulate inventory from other sellers by buying up popular medical equipment for resale. If you happen to have a high amount of used medical equipment at your disposal, you may want to consider setting up your own resale shop, allowing you to reap the highest profits off the sales of the equipment. Keep in mind there are many resale shops for medical equipment online with a large amount of inventory and a solid customer base.

Not all symptoms share the same underlying issue.  Consider talking to a licensed therapist or counselor to help determine the cause of your anxiety. For example, “ligyrophobia” is the fear of sudden and unexpected loud noises. Maybe your fear is more related to the sudden, unexpected nature of a fire alarm rather than the alarm itself.  Phonophobia and ligyrophobia may be related to sensory processing disorder, or SPD. SPD occurs when the brain has trouble sending and receiving signals, and is sometimes linked to various other conditions, such as ADHD, autism, and genetic conditions. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown great success in handling phobias and anxiety disorders. The first step in most treatment programs is to identify the false associations that your mind is making to the fire alarm. Ask yourself:   “What is it that I fear exactly?” ”What am I ultimately afraid will happen?” ”Why do I think this will happen?” ”When do these thoughts arise?” Alone and with help from others, call yourself out when you make an irrational association. Each time the unwarranted fear strikes you, make it a point to pause and challenge the thought.  Tell yourself, “This is not a rational fear.” Consider your fear a “false alarm” that your mind has created. Remind yourself, “I do not need to fear this sound. It is only a warning, an alert.” Enlist friends to call you out kindly when you make irrational associations. Just challenging your negative associations and thoughts is not enough. Each time the anxiety strikes you, challenge the thought and then offer a positive, rational replacement for it.  Replace “what if” fears with “what else” options.  For example, you might say, “I will not burst into flames as soon as I hear this sound. I will walk out of the house is an orderly manner.” Maybe you say to yourself, “This sound is not dangerous. In fact, it helps me survive and keeps me safe.” Acceptance and commitment therapy focuses on working on accepting the discomfort of life without a judgment. Through ACT, you can build a commitment to behavioral change using mindfulness, or living in and accepting the present moment. If replacing negative thoughts with positive thoughts has limited success, try changing the way you relate to that negative thought in the first place. Tell yourself:  \"I know that his fear is uncomfortable for me right now, but it will pass, and it doesn't mean that I'm defective or broken - it just is.\" \"This moment is uncomfortable, and that's part of life, just like good moments are. I can deal with both the bad and the good.\" Before you try exposure therapy, you will want to practice a set of relaxation skills or coping mechanisms to help you work through the anxiety caused by continued exposure to the fire alarm. You might try:  Breathing or counting exercises. Yoga or meditation practices. A repeated phrase or mantra to refocus your mind. Movements or exercise to alleviate stress. Visualization exercises. Progressive muscle relaxation. In exposure therapy, individuals attempt to desensitize themselves to the fear of fire alarms through incremental exposure. For example, you can confront the sound yourself for longer and longer periods of time, or you can ask a friend to test your home fire alarm at random times until the sound becomes familiar and normal to you. Do not attempt exposure until you have mastered relaxation techniques, so you will be able to calm yourself if the exposure creates too much anxiety.  Make a list of increasingly difficult situations and work through it slowly from least to most anxious. Try recording the sound of a fire alarm on your smart phone and listening to it at a higher and higher volume over time. Search for videos of fire alarms on the Internet and let them play while you are doing chores to desensitize yourself to the jarring sound. If you fear the actual fire more than the alarm, try lighting candles with every meal to familiarize yourself with safe, controlled flames. Engage the relaxation skills you learned earlier as you increase in anxiety. Never pull a public fire alarm when there is no fire or no drill, even if you are practicing exposure therapy. This may be a felony, and you could put other people's lives in danger. As you become more familiar with the fire alarm and more relaxed around the sound, you will naturally build new associations for your body and mind. The more you tangibly prove to yourself that hearing a fire alarm will not harm you, the less frequently your anxiety will occur.  Confront the alarm with friends or in otherwise pleasant conditions to associate new memories to that particular sound. New, positive memories act as living proof that the alarm cannot hurt you.", "output": "Trouvez la racine. Identifiez les pensées irrationnelles et négatives.

The adhesive backing is roughly as strong as the glue on the back of a sticky note, if not a little stronger, so it's easy to remove. If you remove it carefully, you can often reuse it, too. If you need to cover the entire wall, measure the dimensions of the space and buy a large enough roll to fit your needs. This can be an expensive option, though, so you can also use smaller strips to cover small patches of imperfections if doing so would suit your needs. Like adhesive wallpaper, adhesive tiles are a good way to mimic the look of the real thing without committing to anything more permanent.  You can use this to cover a large wall, but it makes an especially useful option for small wall spaces like kitchen backsplashes. These tiles are also fairly thin, so you should have no difficulty trimming them down to better cover the size and dimensions of your space. Since the outer surface is smooth and hard, you should be able to keep them clean with a soft cloth. Like adhesive wallpaper, peel-and-stick tiles are relatively easy to remove. If any residue gets left behind, you should be able to clean it off with a standard household cleanser. If you're up to a challenge, use colored or patterned tape to create simple patterns over the wall. You can plan out the pattern so that the tape falls out over the imperfections you want to hide. Duct tape should adhere well and is available in a variety of styles, giving you more options to work with. Consider applying it in diamond patches, stripes, or zigzags. Vinyl décor decals are essentially large stickers designed for use on painted walls. Choose a design you like and simply adhere it directly over the spot you want to cover up.

You don't have to be fake, but you do need to decide what parts of yourself you will present to the public. In other words, you want some consistency. One example of a YouTuber who created a personal brand is Hannah Hart of My Drunk Kitchen. Her personal brand relies on a pinch of silliness with a side of compassion, as she encourages people to get involved in their communities. When building your brand, you do need to offer something to the world. You know about things, and you can use what you know. In other words, your brand can be about what you are an expert on, whether it's robots, cooking, or painting pretty nails. For instance, certain bloggers rely on their expertise to build their brand, such as Joy the Baker, who began a baking blog to share her love of baking with others. She's gained a number of followers due to her precision in cooking, her imaginative recipes, and her honest writing style. With all the social media platforms out there, it's easy to start sharing content with users. You can write blogs, tweet, make videos, or take photographs. Some people do all of the above. Basically, you want to start showing off what you know about by sharing expert content. If you're serious about creating a brand for yourself, you should consider creating your own website. That way, your fan base will have one landing place to find out all about you. Being famous is a business. That means you need to continually be on top of putting yourself out there. On the internet, networking is done through bonding with other content creators. In other words, you need to comment and share other people's content to help push yourself ahead as well. You can also try techniques such as blog tours, where you ask certain blogs (relevant to what you do) to host you as a guest. The host could interview you, or you could write a guest blog post. Take a critical eye to all of your social media. Whatever content doesn't fit your prescribed brand should be taken down. You can also set up a Google Alert for your name to see what is being said about you out there. For instance, if you are trying to portray yourself as family-friendly, you might want to take down pictures of you out partying. That is, don't post everything that comes into your hand.

Given time, gasoline will clean the oxygen sensors. Make sure that the sensors are fully immersed in the gasoline, and that none of the liquid splashes out of the container or gets on your hands. Never smoke, light a candle, or have any other type of open flame when working near gasoline. Due to the flammable nature of gasoline, it's important that you cover the bucket or industrial container of gasoline. This will prevent the gas from catching fire, and also keep any wandering animals from accessing the gas. If the industrial container came with a lid, you can use this to cover the gas. Make sure to seal the lid tightly. If you're soaking the sensors in a bucket or a container that does not have its own lid, you'll need to find something to cover the opening with. Look for an appropriately sized lid among your pots and pans in the kitchen, or simply place a piece of plywood or a large book over the bucket opening. The gas won't clean the oxygen sensors immediately; you'll need to let them soak for at least 8 hours. At some point while the sensors are soaking in the container of gas, pick the container up and swirl it around several times. This will ensure that all parts of the sensors are being cleaned by the gasoline. After the sensors have soaked overnight, you'll need to reach into the bucket or container of gasoline and remove the sensors.

This isn't to excuse any manipulatively controlling behavior. Rather, it's about keeping things in perspective and acknowledging that there may be times when you have exasperated someone! Be honest in your self-assessment if you really want to get to the heart of the bossing. Here are some things to consider:  Have you done anything (or failed to do something) that may have provoked the controlling attitude? For example, if you fail to meet deadlines regularly or you never clean up your room, you shouldn't be surprised if someone responsible either for your upbringing or your pay-check gets a little bossy with you. Bossy people can often ramp up their bossiness in face of what they perceive as unhelpful. In particular, bossy people find passive-aggressive behavior similar to a red rag to a bull — it simply causes them to become even more controlling because they're frustrated at the underhanded response. It is better to be open with your discontent and to assert yourself than to seek the undermine the bossy person. Nobody is a saint when it comes to being bossy — each of us has a tendency to boss others around at different times in life. It may be when you know something in great detail, it may be because you're in a position of authority, or you may just feel a little pushier than usual due to anxiety or pressure, but there will be times in your life when you get bossy. Use your memory of this experience to help you understand the constantly bossy person a little better and perhaps see the reason behind their behavior. Try to be more sensitive to other people when you feel the bossy trigger — notice their reactions. In doing so, you learn a lot about handling the emotions controlling people feel a lot of the time. You can possibly do this by discussing the matter (privately) with a third, uninvolved party. Be sure to choose someone who can be trusted with the information, who understands how to deal with similar situations, and who knows you well enough to give you accurate feedback.

Warm water weakens hair structure and raises it from the skin, making shaving less irritating. In addition, always apply a shaving cream or gel before shaving to lubricate your skin. Avoid shaving with just soap and water. This is not enough to lubricate your skin and may lead to nicks, cuts, and other skin irritations. After applying shaving cream or gel, wait a minute or so before you start to shave. This will allow the cream or gel to reach the base of each hair shaft. It will raise each individual hair and moisturize your skin. It is easier to shave raised hairs and moisturized skin. Your razor will be less likely to cause irritation or ingrown hairs as a result. Avoid shaving with dull blades. Check the razor's lubricating strip before you start shaving. If it's worn down or faded, switch to a new one. If the razor feels dull when you start to shave, you should switch it out for a new one as well. Plan on changing your razor after every 3 to 6 uses. You may have to change it more often depending on the quality of the blade and the coarseness of your hair. No matter where you’re shaving, also go in the direction that your hair grows. Shaving against the grain pulls hair, can cause ingrown hair, causes irritation, and can cut the skin. All of these can increase hyper pigmentation. Be gentle, proceed slowly, and avoid applying too much pressure on your razor. Rinse the razor with hot water after every couple strokes to prevent too much hair from collecting between the blades. When you’ve finished shaving, you should wash your freshly shaved skin using a gentle cleanser. Rinse the area with cool water and dab dry with a towel after cleansing. Avoid skin cleansers that contain alcohol. If you want to go with a natural cleanser, consider applying witch hazel or tea tree oil to freshly shaved skin. This will help your skin recover and prevent irritation. You only need to rub a small amount of moisturizer over the area. Leaving too much residue behind can block pores and weigh down individual hair shafts, which leads to ingrown hairs.

This means that each kitten will suckle for 5 to 10 minutes every 1 to 2 hours – night and day! To be successful hand raising kittens there are no short cuts and each one must be fed every 1 to 2 hours for the first week of its life. Here is a sample feeding schedule:  1-3 days old — feed 2.5ml of milk replacer every 1-2 hours 4-7 days — feed 2.5–5 milliliters (0.08–0.2  fl oz) every 2 hours 6-10 days — feed 5 – 7.5ml, every 2-3 hours 11-14 days — feed 10-12.5 ml every 3 hours 15-21 days — feed 10 ml every 3 hours 21 days to 6 weeks — feed 12.5–25 milliliters (0.4–0.8  fl oz), every 6-8 hours in addition to a normal diet You will know if a kitten is still hungry because she will cry, and hunt around for the teat as if unsettled. Some premature kittens have a weak suckling reflex and don't find it easy to suckle from a teat. If this, gently open her mouth by inserting a fingertip between her upper and lower lips. Using a syringe loaded with milk replacer, drip one drop of milk at a time onto her tongue. Allow it to trickle back and trigger her swallowing reflex. Time and patience is crucial since this process cannot be rushed. Never do more than a few drops in at a time, since larger volumes may run down into her windpipe before she has a chance to swallow. This could cause the kitten to drown. after each feeding. Young kittens cannot empty their bladder or bowels on their own until their second or third week of life. Instead they hold onto their toilet until the mother licks their anus and genital area which stimulates them to defecate and urinate. You will need to stimulate this reflex using moistened cotton balls after each feeding. Use the following process:  After the kittens have been fed, use a cotton wool ball moistened with warm water to gently wipe the kitten's bottom. As you wipe the kitten’s bottom, the kitten should soil the cotton wool. After the kitten has urinated or defecated, discard the cotton ball in the trash. Use another moistened cotton ball if necessary. Dry off the kitten’s bottom with a clean dry towel before putting the kitten back into its nest. Repeat this process 3 or 4 times a day, washing your hands after each time. The kittens should defecate once per day and urinate each time you use this process. If they do not urinate every time, then they may not be getting enough water. Kittens may become sick if they are exposed to germs and this can be a major threat to their survival Always wash your hands with soap and water before handling the kittens. You may also want to keep a clean shirt handy to put on over your everyday clothes prior to picking the kittens up so as to reduce the risk of contamination from the outside world.  Take care to sterilize all bottles and teats between uses to decrease the risk of infection, too. To do this, use a sterilizing product designed for human baby bottles, like Milton solution. Or, if you have access to a steam sterilizer, this can also work well. Change the kittens’ bedding every day.

When you walk into your apartment, the lights should already be turned down low—just enough for your lady to see you, but not so brightly that she feels self-conscious. Light a few candles. If you don't have any candles, just have a few lights on that make the room dim. Have a sexy-smelling apartment. If you know you'll be having a lady over on a particular night, open your windows during the day and let in some fresh air. Some manly potpourri can help your apartment stay fresh too. When your lady arrives, casually light some incense, or make sure those candles are scented. You can also use a nice scented air freshener. Play sexy music. Your lady will be more turned on if you turn on the right music. Jazz can make her feel sophisticated, and R&B can put her in a sexy mood. Whatever you choose, make sure you're casual about putting it on, and play it softly. Your home should be prepared for sexiness in advance, so the mood can stay hot and you can avoid interruptions. Here are a few key items to always have in stock:  Something to drink. Be prepared with red and white wine and any other beverages that your lady may like. Chances are that you've come back from drinking at a sexy dinner date, and to keep things going, you should always have something extra to sip on just in case. Something to eat. If you need more time to warm up to get to the bedroom, sharing a sexy snack can help set the mood. Be prepared with sexy foods like grapes, strawberries, cheese and crackers, or chocolate. Avoid eating anything greasy or fried that can give you gas, which will definitely not be a turn on. Something to clean up with. If you plan on doing the deed, have a clean towel and fresh soap for your girl, so you don't turn her off by giving her a wet, moldy towel. Work as hard as you can to have a home that will turn the ladies on immediately. Your home should be presentable so your girl wants to venture into the bedroom. Here's how:  Be clean. This is the most important part of setting the mood. Hide your dirty laundry, clean all surfaces in your home, and absolutely make sure you don't have a grimy bathroom. Your girl should be as comfortable as possible before she can be ready for action. Be fashionable. Your home doesn't have to be worth a million dollars to turn a lady on.

The acorn develops within a cup-like structure called a cupule. The cupule delivers the nutrients that flow from the roots and leaves all through the tree, along the branches, and through the stem into the acorn. When the acorn rests with its point facing down, the cupule should look like a sort of cap atop the nut. The cap is not a part of the acorn, technically, so much as a protective covering. Each acorn typically contains one oak seed, although the occasional nut contains two or three. An acorn takes 6 to 18 months to mature into a sprouting oak seedling; acorns sprout best in a moist (but not too moist) environment, and their growth is naturally activated by the cold-snap temperatures of a Northern Hemisphere winter.  Acorns have evolved to be deliciously appealing to deer, squirrels, and other woodland creatures. When animals eat the acorns that litter the forest floor, they take tiny oak seeds on board. When they excrete the digested acorn seeds--or, in the case of squirrels, compulsively hide acorns and then forget about them in the springtime--they spread the oak's seeds throughout their ecosystem. Most seeds do not survive to become full-fledged oak trees, but the ones that do survive eventually begin to produce acorns of their own. When an acorn falls to the ground, it has roughly a 1 in 10,000 chance of becoming a full-fledged oak tree--so you can imagine why it behooves the oak to produce so many! Acorns may vary in size and color, but most are characterized by a bumpy \"cap\" and a smooth, pointed bottom. The following measurements may help you gather information about a tree:  Observe the stem on which the acorn grows. Notice the length of the stem and how many acorns grow from it. Note the appearance of the cupule. The nut of the acorn grows from a woody cup, which may remind you of a head wearing a hat. Cupules may be scaly and include wart-like hairy growths which may take the form of a fringe, or may be characterized by color changes such as concentric rings. Some species have long nuts, while others are fat and almost spherical. Measure how much of the acorn the cupule covers.  As a general rule, full-grown red oak acorns are slightly larger: 3/4 to 1 inch long, with the cupule covering about 1/4 of the nut.  Full-grown white oak acorns tend to be slightly smaller: 1/2 to 3/4 inch long. Note the color of the nut, whether it has a pointed end, and whether it has any other distinguishing features like ridges or stripes.  Red oak acorns tend to take on a rich reddish-brown color, while white oak acorns tend to favor pale-gray hues. White oak species produce acorns on a one year cycle; these acorns contain fewer tannins and taste better to the woodland creatures--deer, birds, and rodents--that eat them, but they are more sporadic from year to year in acorn production. Red oak species take two years to mature an acorn, but they reproduce yearly, and they commonly provide a reliable crop on a yearly early basis. Although the red oak acorns contain more tannins and, in theory, don't \"taste as good\", this doesn't seem to deter woodland creatures from gobbling any acorns they can find. Red oak acorns usually contain large amounts of fats and carbs, but white oak acorns contain the highest carb content.", "output": "Quel rôle les glands jouent-ils ?

The number refers to the percentage of particles that the mask can filter out. The N95 mask filters out 95% of dust and particulates. N95 masks shouldn’t be used if oil aerosols are present, as oil damages the filter. The “N” actually stands for “Not resistant to oil.” Depending on the particular N95 mask you choose, available sizes range from extra small and small to medium and large. If possible, try on a couple of sizes before you purchase one. Make sure the mask feels snug and doesn’t slip on your face, remembering that you’ll also mold it to your face for an even tighter fit.

If the lice is a resistant strain, your doctor may prescribe a prescription drug or an alternative remedy. If your area is not affected by super lice, you can use an OTC product to get rid of the lice. If your child has lice, you should wash all the sheets, towels, blankets, and clothes that may have had contact with your child’s hair. This helps remove any bugs or eggs so they don’t reinfect your child. Wash the linens in hot water. This can help kill the eggs and bugs. In addition to washing the linens, you should vacuum all surfaces. This includes carpet, rugs, furniture, car seats, and pillows you can wash. This helps remove any bugs that have fallen off your child’s head. Vacuuming can also remove any eggs that have stuck to surfaces. If you can’t get rid of the lice, or you don’t have time to comb through your child’s hair, you can take your child to a lice salon. These are establishments where someone will comb through your child’s hair for you. They may also use heat to kill the bugs and eggs. These salons may be expensive and not available in all areas. Catching the infestation of lice at the beginning is one of the best ways to get rid of it. This helps you stop more eggs from hatching before they get too bad. Check your child’s hair once a week for signs of eggs or lice.  Use a metal comb that is fine-toothed. The space between the teeth of the comb should be small enough to pull out the tiny eggs or bugs in the child’s hair. Separate your hair into small sections. This helps you get a good look at your child’s scalp and hair in case they only have a few nits or eggs. Your child catches lice from other children who have lice or eggs in their hair. Teach your child not to share anything that touches the head, like combs, brushes, hair accessories, hats, helmets, or anything else.  Use caution when placing head items, like hats, helmets, or scarves, in communal spaces.

Google is your friend in this adventure. You should not be looking at what others are doing in order to copy them. Instead, you should be seeing where their ideas fall short or what pieces of their project might fit into yours. Once you see what run-of-the-mill folks are doing, find out what the innovators are doing. Seek out the cutting edge and fringe ideas or techniques that other people are experimenting with. You might want to similarly experiment! Such innovation can set you apart, making what you do unique, memorable, and appealing. Get outside of your usual environment. This is a great way to break yourself out of the standard creation loop and think of things that you've never thought of before. Go for a walk, go to a local artisan or farmer's market, or work in a cafe for a while. Any change of environment can help you think in different ways. Always have a journal next to your bed. You'll also want to keep a waterproof note-taking option in your shower area. Good ideas often sneak up on us when we're doing these other activities, but then get lost as we get distracted with whatever else it is we're doing. By having a pen and paper nearby, you'll be able to quickly jot down the things you think of before they fly away! It's important to take breaks, to keep your mind clear of negative response loops. A lot of the time, when you're thinking and coming up with nothing, you get too focused on the fact that you're coming up with nothing, making it impossible to really think. Try having a healthy snack, catch up with a coworker, or do a quick chore (such as cleaning up your mess from dinner). During the brainstorming process, criticism isn't helpful. You'll need the freedom of minimal boundaries in order to get to new ideas. Leave criticism for once you have a long list of possibilities.  If you're brainstorming with other people, you might need to remind some people to keep negative opinions to themselves until the brainstorming activity is done. Try to frame your brainstorming as your time to collect new ideas and materials.

If you have time before embarking on a trip or meeting with someone from another culture, try to take time to learn the basic “do’s and dont’s” of that culture. You can find information on this from internet sources such as those provided by the National Center for Cultural Competence. Different cultures will speak at different volumes, be more or less direct in showing emotion, may or may not expect to engage in “small talk,” and exhibit other dissimilarities in communication. When communicating with people from other cultures, be prepared to encounter such differences, including ones that you were not aware of. When communicating with a different culture, there may be unwritten rules about social hierarchy that you are not used to. For instance, you may come from a culture where men and women are expected to communicate equally with each other but may have to interact with someone from a culture where men may do more talking in mixed company. Similarly, you may be communicating with someone who expects that a younger person should let an older person do most of the talking, while you expect people across age groups to communicate equally. If you could not understand someone or think that he or she did not understand you, say something about it. Avoid being rude or offensive, but patiently explain the problem. It’s usually better to be upfront than to let a problem in communication go undressed, since there may otherwise be bigger problems later.  If you think you did not understand what someone meant, try saying something like: “I’m not sure I understood you. Could we go over that again?” If you think that someone did not understand you, try saying something like: “Let’s review things to make sure we’re all on the same page.” You can also make sure to let the person know to ask questions. Each culture has its own set of dominant values, beliefs, and prejudices. Signs of these may emerge when communicating with people from other cultures. Basic communication, however, it is not the time to judge people based on these differences. Instead, respect them for what they are, and tolerate them. You may even learn something new. Even if cultural differences come up explicitly in conversation, be tolerant and open-minded instead of argumentative. For instance, if you are American and someone comments on Americans’ tendency to be work-focused, say something like: “Yes, it’s true that many Americans take work seriously, and there are a lot of reasons for that. Why don’t  you tell me some more about how your culture thinks about work?” Communicating with people from other cultures can be enlightening and rewarding, but also have its difficulties.

I hope you had a good time.” You could also say something more forward, like, “I had a great time hanging out with you last weekend. Hope we can do it again soon!” This is a little less risky than coming right out and saying, “I like you.” It’s a nice way to compliment him while letting him know you feel fondly toward him. No one ever minds hearing that someone enjoys their company!  At the end of a hangout, simply say, “This was fun. I enjoy spending time with you,” and smile at him. If he asks you to do something, say, “Yeah, that sounds like fun.

Before you know it, he may even be coming to you and asking you to hang out. Be careful if this guy seems like a bit of a flirt. It’s possible that he could have several other people that he hangs out with regularly that are also interested in him.

Do your best to focus on being his friend and on keeping a positive attitude. If you get really impatient and need to tell him that you like him to see if he feels the same way, you can totally do that.

This means you can easily find out what key the song was written in and the chords that were used. Or if you have sheet music, you can simply look at the key signature. Fool around on your guitar as you listen to the song 2 or 3 times. This may give you some early ideas for key tones or short licks that sound good. Pentatonic scales include 5 notes of the regular scale, removing the 4th and 7th notes from each octave. The shape you make with your fretting hand can be moved up and down the neck to play the pentatonic scales of different keys.  The Minor Pentatonic Scale is a versatile scale used in rock, blues, and pop songs, as well as some jazz music. For a song in E minor, you would play:E|---------------------0-3-|B|-----------------0-3-----|G|-------------0-2---------|D|---------0-2-------------|A|-----0-2-----------------|E|-0-3---------------------| The Major Pentatonic Scale is happier and brighter than the minor pentatonic scale and can be used in similarly bright songs.

The pentatonic scale pattern sounds great over any chord change, so it frees you up to experiment a little and find something that sounds good. At this stage, you're just playing around. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to come up with the perfect solo on the spot. Just make a note of particular phrases you find that you really like. Try playing over the song again, and pick out 8 to 10 powerful notes that will serve as a sort of outline for your solo. Typically you'll place these notes on or immediately after chord changes.

Acne can be painful and the scars probably won't go away on their own so getting medical attention is important. Your primary care physician may need to refer you to a dermatologist in order for your insurance to cover the exam. Or, your doctor may simply recommend dermatologists who specialize in cystic acne. Dermabrasion or microdermabrasion removes the top layers of skin and is used for small scars. It is the most common treatment for acne scars. The dermatologist may apply a local anesthetic and will use tools that carefully sand away the top layer of skin. If your cystic acne covers a large area of skin, your dermatologist may give you a sedative or recommend general anesthesia if your procedure will be more complex. Your skin will be red and swollen after the treatment. The swelling should go down within 2 or 3 weeks. If you have more severe acne scars, the dermatologist may want to remove the topmost layer of skin. For a deep peel, you'll probably get general anesthesia so you'll be asleep during the procedure. The dermatologist will apply the chemical peel to small patches of your skin and remove it along with your top layer of skin which will remove the cystic acne scars. If you had a deep peel, the dermatologist will show you how to change your surgical bandages after the procedure. If you had a moderate peel, you'll probably need to apply cool compresses and lotion. If you have ice pick (punched-out) scars, you may be able to remove them by getting a dermal filler injection. During this procedure, collagen (a protein approved by the FDA) is injected under your skin to fill in the pits caused by acne. Your dermatologist may also use steroid injections for scars that are hyper-pigmented or darker than surrounding skin. Pulsed dye lasers or intense pulsed light can be used to treat raised acne scars. These high energy light beams burn away damaged skin and scars. Once the scars have been burned away, your skin is more likely to heal normally and without any scarring. Less intensive lasers and lights can be used to leave your skin intact while stimulating the collagen underneath your skin. For this form of scar treatment, a dermatologist runs a roller with small needles on it over the scarred area. Each needle punctures your skin and as the puncture wounds heal, your skin produces collagen which helps to fill in the gaps in and around the scars. Multiple treatments are required to get the best results from this treatment. You will also have some swelling as a result of the therapy, but it is only temporary.", "output": "Allez vous faire examiner. Essayez la dermabrasion ou la microdermabrasion.

Anger can be useful when harnessed properly, but if you let it run wild, it can quickly overwhelm you. The reactions that follow could also lead to depression. Some immediate steps you can take to calm yourself include deep breathing and positive self-talk. Try taking a few deep breaths from your diaphragm. Once you've steadied your breathing, repeat a calming word or phrase like \"breathe,\" \"relax,\" or \"it'll be okay.\" These actions cut your angry thoughts off before they can build to a heightened state. Step away from the cause of your anger and take some time to calm down. Distracting yourself and releasing the powerful burst of energy in a controlled, healthy manner can take the edge off your anger and help you control it more effectively.  Consider exercising to expel excess energy. Go for fast-paced walk or jog. Jump rope or do jumping jacks. Any form of exercise that gets your blood pumping can help. Alternatively, do something that relaxes and distracts you. Listen to soothing music. Take a bubble bath. Hang out with friends. Doing things that create positive energy may help you balance out the negative emotions you currently feel. Turn to someone you trust and talk to them about your feelings. Make sure that you vent your anger without inflicting it upon your confidant. In other words, talk to him or her about your anger and its source without getting angry at the individual listening to you.  Wait until you're calm enough to control your emotions around other people. If you lash out at your confidant, you may damage your relationship and create feelings of guilt that could feed into depression. As you talk through things, be open to constructive criticism and feedback. If your confidant has advice on how you can compromise or change for the better, consider it as rationally as possible. An alternate way to process your emotions is through writing. Consider keeping a record of your angry thoughts and experiences. Doing so can calm you down and help you understand your anger better in the long run. Periodically read through your journal. Ideally, you'll eventually gather insights regarding the things that trigger your anger and your usual method of reacting to it. You may also notice patterns that connect anger to depression. It might seem impossible to find humor in a situation that initially causes nothing but rage, but finding humor in the crazy, chaotic happenings of life can make it easier to confront those circumstances.  Some circumstances are too serious to laugh about, of course, and you don't need to push yourself to find humor in a truly humorless situation. If you can't find humor in the situation responsible for your anger, try looking for humor elsewhere. Doing so can distract your mind away from your angry thoughts and balance your emotional state. Ideally, you should try wishing your opponent well by hoping for a positive resolution that satisfies you both. When this is impossible, though, try focusing your thoughts, wishes, and prayers outside of your own situation and on someone else you can care about more easily.  Try to look at the situation from your opponent's perspective to garner compassion for him or her. Even if you still feel that your opponent was in the wrong, the intensity of your feelings may soften as compassion builds. This can also make it easier to forgive the person who wronged you. If you aren't able to wish your opponent well right now, focus on wishing happiness on someone uninvolved. Thinking positive, healing thoughts toward anyone can help shift your mind out of its enraged state and may prevent you from lashing out at others. When you're angry or depressed, it can be tempting to turn to alcohol or other substances that help numb the anger and pain you feel. Doing so will ultimately result in more harm than good, though.  Alcohol and drugs can increase the risk of acting on impulse, and if you're still enraged over your situation, that might have profoundly negative consequences. Moreover, relying on drugs and alcohol can create unhealthy behavioral patterns that could result in future difficulties.", "output": "Calmez-vous immédiatement. Faites une pause.

For instance, let's say you're in a committed relationship with a woman you love but you frequently feel intense guilt because you flirt with other women. Search your heart. Ask yourself, \"what do I think or do that makes me want to act like this?\" After some reflection, you may find, for instance, that you're worried about whether you're still attractive. The source of your temptation in this case is your sense of insecurity. Your aim when fighting temptation should take into account the fact that, as a human being, you're incapable of perfection. Don't set an un-achievable goal like \"I will never sin again.\" If you do, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Realize that you will inevitably sin again (and again and again). Set a realistic goal that takes this into account.   For instance, if you've been neglecting your child's vocal recitals in favor of nights spent at home watching TV, you might set a goal of never missing another vocal recital (except for emergencies) and of reducing your time spent watching TV every week by four hours. This goal is well within your grasp. For a few very serious sins, it is  absolutely necessary  to set a zero-tolerance goal - for instance, you should obviously never commit murder or marital infidelity. These sins can cause irreparable damage to others' lives. You were blessed with free will for a reason. Don't waste your opportunity to act decisively against your personal temptation by giving into the separate temptation of inaction! Stand up and take action  now.  Make it your goal going forward to not give in to your temptation. The hardest part of overcoming your temptation can be getting started. Don't sabotage your journey before it's begun by telling yourself you can't do it.  According to Christianity, when Jesus died, he gave us authority over the forces of evil. (Mark 16:17) Never fear or run from the forces of evil in your own life. With hard work and sincere faith, nothing is beyond your grasp. The one thing you can't change about yourself is your past. Don't let yourself be overcome by regret for sins that happened in the past. The only right path is forward, towards righteousness. If your past is marked by sin, acknowledge your mistakes without excessive guilt. Build upon your past mistakes. Strive never to make your old mistakes again. Even if you relapse, you'll have made progress away from your sinful past. If you haven't already, sincerely ask God for forgiveness. God is infinite in his capacity to forgive. In his eyes, once you are forgiven, it's as if you had never committed sin in the first place:  Islam: \"Whoever commits evil or wrongs themselves then seeks Allah’s forgiveness will certainly find Allah All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (Qur'an 4:110)  Islam: \"Abu Qatadah reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Verily, you will never leave anything for the sake of Allah Almighty but that Allah will replace it with something better.'\" (Musnad Aḥmad 22565, Grade: Sahih)  \"And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.\" (Hebrews 10:17)", "output": "Identifiez vos tentations et vos défauts personnels qui y contribuent.

If you love a guy, you may find yourself thinking about him often — even when you don't really want to. If he's the first thing on your mind when you wake up, and the last thing you think of before you go to sleep, this is a sign that you have serious feelings about him. However, infatuation (puppy love) can have the same effect. Since just thinking about someone often isn't enough to say whether you love that person, use the other steps below to help make your decision. The person you love shouldn't be someone you're shy around. Love means that you're extra-comfortable around this guy — you like hanging out with him because he makes you feel like you can be yourself. On the other hand, if this guy still makes you feel nervous, antsy, or insecure, your relationship may not have made it to \"love\" territory yet. If you still get the butterflies around this guy, don't worry. You can eventually love him — you just need to spend more time together and grow more confident around each other. People who love each other tend to enjoy thinking about the rich, rewarding time they've already spent together. If you sit down and think of the things you've done together, do you find yourself feeling warm, happy, or nostalgic emotions? If so, you may have a good foundation for love. If you don't feel an attachment to your memories together, you may not be there yet. If you don't have any memories together, you probably haven't spent enough time with this guy for love to develop. It's natural to have some fantasies of the future when you have a crush — running off together to a tropical retreat, exploring the world, etc. However, when you love someone, your fantasies tend to be a little more realistic. You may find yourself thinking things like, \"I wonder if we can live together when we finish school?\", \"I wonder whether we could get a dog together,\" and so on.

You don't necessarily need a yearly check-up. If you are under 30 and otherwise healthy, going to your doctor once every two to three years is enough. A check-up every other year is sufficient for those between 30 and 40 who do not have any medical conditions. Annual physicals should start at around the age of 50, earlier if you are at special risk or have other health problems. As said before, high blood pressure can increase your risk of arterial problems and over time cause arteries to stiffen. It therefore needs to be treated. In addition to lifestyle changes like diet, exercise, coping with stress, and limiting sodium and alcohol, it is also possible, with your doctor, to treat high blood pressure through medication. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are all common medicines which, in different ways, stop or slow body functions that increase blood pressure. It is not uncommon for someone to take more than one medication for high blood pressure. You may also experience side-effects. In that case, do not stop taking the medication but ask your doctor if she can change the dosage or drug. . As said before, high cholesterol is also an indirect factor in the development of atherosclerosis. Your cholesterol level may be high from your diet and/or from your body making too much cholesterol on its own. Apart from losing weight and reducing your consumption of saturated and trans fats, minding food labels carefully, you may need to ask your doctor for medical help in lowering your cholesterol. Statins, for example, block a substance that your liver needs to make cholesterol, which causes the liver to remove the cholesterol from the blood. Statins not only lower cholesterol levels but help the body absorb existing deposits on artery walls, which can possibly reverse coronary artery disease. Other medications may also protect the arteries by decreasing the inflammation, which is thought to contribute to heart disease. Diabetes can cause hardening of the arteries by leaving severe calcium deposits. People with high levels of calcium in the blood are at greater risk for developing hardening of the arteries, so make sure to manage the disease appropriately if you are diabetic. Check your blood sugar daily. Keep track of your numbers and report these to your doctor. Be familiar with what normal blood sugar levels are and try to keep your readings as close to normal as possible.

Some people suggest soaking in the tub for 15–20 minutes, but according to others just three minutes in the shower is enough to do the trick.  Try doing the rest of your bathing routine first—body cleansing, shampoo, and conditioner—then following with your shave at the end. This will allow maximum time for your skin to soften, regardless of whether you’re in the bath or shower. Hot water, though it might feel pleasant, dries out the skin and should be avoided. When showering or bathing, keep the water at a pleasant, moderate temperature.  Ice cold water should also be avoided, as this is very shocking to the skin. This is a crucial step that will keep dead skin cells from clogging your razor. It’s sometimes tempting to pass on exfoliating, but you really should put in the effort before every shave.

Before you start diving in, it will help to have a basic understand of some of the more common terms.   Traffic - In networking terms, traffic is the transfer of data from one computer to another.  Server - This is a computer located remotely that hosts files and sets up connections. All websites are stored on servers that you access using your web browser.  Encryption - This is the act of protecting data sent over a network by using a randomly generated code. When data is encrypted, it is scrambled according to the unique code that only you and the server have. This ensures that if the data is intercepted, it cannot be decoded.  Proxy - A proxy server is a server that is configured to collect and then resend network traffic. In essence, a proxy server allows you to connect to it, and then it will send out your requests for websites. It then receives the data from the websites and then sends it to you. This has the benefit of hiding your IP address from the website you are accessing.  VPN - A VPN is a Virtual Private Network. This is an encrypted connection between you and a server. It is traditionally used in corporate environments so that remote workers could remotely and securely access company resources. A VPN can be thought of as a \"tunnel\" through the internet that connects you directly with a server. There are thousands of web-based proxies available, and they change every day. These are websites that route traffic through the proxy server. They only affect traffic going through that website; open another tab in your browser and anything you send will be anonymously sent.  When using a web-based proxy, avoid any sites that use secure login (Facebook, banking, etc.) as proxy sites should never be trusted and could steal or leak log in and banking details. Most web-based proxies cannot display certain content such as videos. A proxy server is a server that relays your internet traffic. This has the benefit of masking your personal IP address from sites when you connect through a proxy. The downside is that you have to trust the proxy server to not do anything malicious with your traffic.  There are a wide variety of proxy services available online, both free and paid. Free servers are typically ad-supported. Once you've found a proxy server that you want to connect to, you will need to configure your browser to connect to the server. This will only affect the traffic that originates from your browser (i.e. an instant messaging program will not be relayed through the proxy server unless it is configured to as well). Much like web-based proxies, you should avoid logging into anything secure, as you cannot trust a proxy company to not divulge your data. Do not connect to any \"open\" proxies. These are proxy servers that have been left open by someone else, and are typically malicious or illegal.

New double-pane windows are pricey to purchase ($75-$100), but they save you money in the long run and will significantly increase the value of the home by making it more energy efficient. The front door is the first thing potential buyers see, and repainting a door is a cheap way to make a great first impression. Focus on your entryway to intrigue buyers before they even walk into the house. Green technology is in, and energy efficient houses have a big leg up in the marketplace.

Solar panels can lead to tax breaks for homeowners, which will quickly increase the value of your house. On the other hand, solar panels might be a big concern for the buyer. If you're paying high lease rates to a third party, when the panels break, who will fix them? Also, the cheap imported panels are being leased for 20 years, but they sometimes only last for five to eight years. Over the years, lime mortar used in brick houses will start crumbling and degrading due to reaction with salt in the air. Eventually cracks will appear and the brick walls will become loose.  The process of fixing the old mortar and restoring the brick walls to their original condition is called repointing. It involves removing the old mortar and replacing it with new mortar. Done right, brick pointing will ensure a home’s integrity for at least 40 years. Brick repointing enhances the visual attractiveness of the house and it will increase the likelihood of more people liking the property which in turn will create competition on price.

Talk to your friend about how much you miss them, and assure them that they are a core part of your life.  Say, “You’re like a sister to me, so not having you around is like losing part of my family.” If your friend has been spending a lot of time with a new friend or partner, let them know that you want some of their time, too. Explain that you understand that the new person is important to them and stress that you aren’t trying to drive them apart. Say, “I’m glad you found someone who makes you happy. I just miss hanging out with you.” Be honest with your friend, even if you feel embarrassed. You could say, “It’s been really hard for me lately because you’re my best friend. I’m used to being able to talk to you everyday, but lately I’ve felt like you were too busy for me.” There are several reasons why your friend may be pulling away from you, so don’t think that a few unanswered texts or missed hangouts mean that you’ve lost your best friend. It’s possible that your friend has been going through something stressful or time-demanding, leaving little social time available.  Realize that your friend may have other things going on in their life that have nothing to do with you or any of their other friends. If your friend has been spending a lot of time with someone else, consider that the other person may fit into your friend’s life in a way that you don’t. For example, your friend and the new person may both be from divorced households, may share a similar cultural background, or may have both had to take care of an ill family member. If you’ve done something wrong, apologizing is the first step to healing your friendship. Simply saying “I’m sorry” usually isn’t enough. You need to be detailed and specific. Even if you don’t think the fight was your fault, you might have to take the high road and be the first to apologize.  Show them that you know what you did and why it was wrong. Say, “I’m sorry for forgetting your birthday. I know that must have really hurt you because I would have been heartbroken if you’d forgotten mine.” Don’t speak for both of you or project your feelings onto your friend. You may have differing perspectives on what happened and what your intentions were, and that’s okay. What’s important is that you are each able to share your own feelings on the situation and come to a point of understanding. Avoid statements like “You never listen to me!” Instead, say, “I felt like you weren't hearing me, and that made me feel frustrated.” As you apologize, resist the urge to explain away your behavior. Don’t make excuses, no matter how justified you felt in doing what you did or what was happening in your life. Nothing excuses hurting your friend, just as they have no excuse for hurting you.  For example, avoid saying, “I’m sorry I forgot about your birthday party. I had a busy week and lost track of the days.” While this may be true, it weakens your apology because it shows that you feel like your behavior had some justification. Say, “I know that what I did was wrong.” Regardless of who started the fight or what was said, focus on moving forward. Think about how much you want your best friend in your life, and remind yourself that pointing out who did what will only hurt the situation.  Avoid statements like “I’m sorry you feel that way” because they put the blame on the other person. You are telling the person that your behavior was okay, and they just overreacted. If you feel like they are unfairly blaming you, say, “I’m hearing that you think this is all my fault. Is that true?” If they reply yes, then you will be able to talk it out. Talking to your friend will start the healing process, but may not be enough to fully restore your relationship. Offer ideas for things you can do together, including a next step. Healing your friendship will require work, and your apology will hold more weight if you show your friend that you have a plan. Ask them to go see a popular movie together. You can spend time together without expectations of talking, and then you have a shared topic to discuss afterward that will put less pressure on you to find neutral topics.", "output": "Dites-lui ce que vous ressentez.

Add the sliced onions once the butter melts and Sauté until soft and brown.  Sliced onion will take about 15 to 20 minutes to cook. You will need to stir the onions occasionally to prevent them from burning or sticking to the pan. If you want to distribute the onion flavor more evenly throughout the dish, you could use chopped onion instead of onion slices. Note that chopped onions will only take 7 to 12 minutes to cook. Place the uncooked freekeh grains in a medium bowl and fill the bowl with cold water. Let soak for 5 minutes. It is recommended that you do this while the onions are cooking to minimize the amount of time it takes to prepare the dish overall. Pour the freekeh and water through a sieve and rinse well under cold, running water. Let drain completely.  The purpose of soaking, draining, rinsing, and re-draining is to help clean the grains. Make sure that the holes in the sieve are very small to prevent the loss of grains. Toss the freekeh, cinnamon, and allspice into the saucepan with the onions. Stir well to combine. Pour the vegetable stock into the saucepan and sprinkle with a pinch each of salt and black pepper. Stir to mix and bring to a boil. Stir the contents of the saucepan periodically as they reach a boiling point to prevent uneven cooking. Once the liquid begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and let it all simmer gently for 15 minutes. Cover the saucepan as the freekeh cooks to avoid losing water through evaporation. Losing too much water can cause the freekeh to be hard and undercooked. Once the freekeh seems tender, remove the saucepan from the stove and let it stand for 5 minutes covered and 5 more minutes uncovered.  Letting the freekeh stand while covered allows the grains to finish absorbing the water. Letting it stand uncovered lets the freekeh cool down slightly. In a small, separate bowl, whisk together the three ingredients until smooth and evenly distributed.  Add a sprinkle of salt, if desired, to draw out more of the flavors. Save time by doing this step as you wait for the freekeh to cool. Once the pilaf is warm instead of hot, stir in the parsley, mint, and coriander until evenly distributed throughout the pilaf. Taste the pilaf and adjust the seasonings as needed. Scoop the freekeh pilaf into individual serving dishes and garnish each portion with a spoonful of the yogurt mix. Garnish with pine nuts.

For example, the inequality x(x+4)<21{\\displaystyle x(x+4)<21} is not in standard form. First, you need to use the distributive property to multiply x{\\displaystyle x} and x+4{\\displaystyle x+4}. Then, you need to subtract 21 from both sides of the inequality:x(x+4)<21{\\displaystyle x(x+4)<21}x2+4x<21{\\displaystyle x^{2}+4x<21}x2+4x−21<21−21{\\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<21-21}x2+4x−21<0{\\displaystyle x^{2}+4x-21<0} To factor the inequality, you need to find two binomials whose product equals the standard form of the inequality. A binomial is a two-termed expression. To do this, you need to complete the  FOIL method in reverse. Begin by finding two factors for the first term of each binomial. For example, x×x=x2{\\displaystyle x\\times x=x^{2}}, so you can begin setting up your factors like this: (x)(x)<0{\\displaystyle (x)(x)<0}. These two factors must also have a sum equal to the second term in the inequality. You will likely need to do some guess-and-check work at this time, to see which two factors meet these two requirements. Make sure you pay close attention to the positive and negative signs as well. For example:  7×−3=−21{\\displaystyle 7\\times -3=-21} -21 is the third term in the inequality, so these two factors (7 and -3) might work. Now you need to see whether the sum of these factors equals the second term (4{\\displaystyle 4}) of the inequality. Since 7+−3=4{\\displaystyle 7+-3=4}, these two factors meet both requirements. So, your factored inequality is (x+7)(x−3)<0{\\displaystyle (x+7)(x-3)<0}.", "output": "Si ce n’est pas déjà fait, récrivez l’inégalité sous sa forme développée. Factorisez le premier terme.

Since you can only choose one option, you forfeit the potential returns from the other option.  That loss is your opportunity cost.  For example, suppose your company has $100,000 in extra funds, and you have to decide between investing in securities or purchasing new capital equipment. If you decide to invest in the securities, you may see a return on that investment.  But, you forfeit any profit you might have earned from purchasing new equipment. On the other hand, if you decide to purchase new equipment, you may see a return on that investment in the form of increased sales.  But, you forfeit any profit you might have earned from investing in the securities. Research each option and estimate the financial return on each.  In the above example, suppose the expected return on the investment in the stock market is 12 percent.  Your potential return is $12,000.  The new equipment, on the other hand, might result in a 10 percent increase in your profit margin.  Your potential return for that investment would be $10,000. Sometimes the best option is not the most lucrative, especially in the short term.  Decide which option is best for you based on long term goals, not just on the potential return.  The company in the above example may choose to invest the funds in new equipment instead of the stock market.  Although the stock market investment has the higher potential return in the short term, the new equipment will allow them to increase efficiency and lower opportunity costs.  This will have a long term impact on their profit margin. The opportunity cost is the difference between the most lucrative option and the chosen option.  In the above example, the most lucrative option is investing in the securities, which has a potential return of $12,000.  The option the company chose, however, was to invest in new equipment, for a return of $10,000.

Here are some things to look for:  For plumbing problems, try to determine the location and depth of the underground pipes. Look for an outdoor faucet, sewer cap, or use a line locator. For water problems, look for areas where water is either bubbling up through cracks in the concrete or seeping out around the edges of the slab. For electrical lines, you may find you have to locate the conduit outside the slab area and dig up a length of it to determine where it runs. For other types of repairs, look up the construction blueprints with your municipal government or request them from the contractor who built your home. You may wish to measure distances from the slab's edge to make an even, parallel hole for less visible repairs. Use a pencil or chalk to mark off the location. Since you don’t know what is under the concrete, allow for plenty of room around your repair area to avoid causing further damage. If you are digging toward a specific line or pipe, shut off the power or water before you begin. You don't want to risk electrocution, flooding, or a gas leak. Always call the utility company to find out the location of power lines and other dangerous items before beginning projects that involve digging. the line as deeply as possible. Rent a concrete cutoff or demolition saw. Cut the line evenly to create a clean edge when your work is complete. If you are searching for a broken water pipe, you may have to enlarge the hole after the initial break is done.  Be very cautious while sawing. These saws are powerful and can cause serious injury, property damage, or death if used incorrectly. Always wear a respirator or face mask to protect your lungs from cement dust and always follow the tool's user instructions carefully. Whenever possible, use a wet saw and a steady flow of water to prevent airborne dust and damage to the saw blade. Use a heavy duty hammer drill or a breaking chisel attachment in a rotary hammer to chip the concrete next to the line you sawed. Tilt the chisel so the side you will be removing cracks loose, not the side you're keeping. Using the same tool, work the area around the cut, penetrating deeper each time until you've reached the bottom of the slab. This is the hardest part of the job, since the pieces you break off cannot come free until there is a space for them to drop into. You may need to leave tightly wedged pieces of concrete until the adjacent concrete is broken and removed. Once a gap has been created between the concrete you're removing and the concrete that's staying, chip further with the same tool. Widen it to at least 3 inches (8 cm), or enough to fully remove the broken pieces.  Keep your chisel point slanted toward the beginning hole while you work around the perimeter of the hole, so it doesn't try to penetrate straight down. If the chisel goes too deep, the bit will become lodged in its hole and will be difficult to remove. If a bit is truly stuck, you may need to use a new drill bit to break the concrete around it and free it. Once there is a wide enough gap to avoid damaging the concrete you wish to keep, you can use the techniques described in the section on removing a whole slab.  Use a pry bar as you go for the quickest and most effective results. Do not use a jackhammer or similar power tool if you are near a water pipe, electrical line, or gas line. Remove the broken chunks of concrete from the hole as it becomes larger so you can work more comfortably and spot pipes or electrical wires more easily. Use bolt cutters to snip reinforcing mesh and an angle grinder to cut through reinforcing bars. Once all the concrete is removed, chip the vertical walls of the hole to make them smooth and even. This will ensure a stronger repair (or a more attractive edge if you don't plan on replacing the concrete). If you're trying to find a damage utility such as a water pipe, look for signs as you go, such as water puddles or stains. Once you find the pipe, you may need to continue breaking concrete along its length until you find the damaged section.

The medication is applied along the upper lash line, eventually stimulating longer, thicker, and darker lashes, but you should not apply it to the lower lashes. Usually, doctors instruct you to take the medication daily for two months or more. Possible side effects include itchy or red eyes, dry eyes, darkened eyelids, darkened brown pigmentation in the iris, hair growth around the eyes if the medication continually runs off the eyelids and onto the surrounding skin. There are a variety of health conditions and disorders that could be responsible for your loss of eyelashes. If you have one of these conditions, the only real way to grow eyelashes long-term is to treat the underlying condition.  Eye infections, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, eyelid inflammation, and trichotillomania are all conditions that could be to blame. Doctors may recommend a special cleaning routine for eyelid inflammation and infections. An infection may also warrant the use of antibiotics. Hypothyroidism needs to be treated with thyroid replacement drugs. Trichotillomania is a psychological condition that causes you to pull your eyelashes out.

The vet will examiner her, check on how her pregnancy is advancing, and give you guidance about how to care for her during the pregnancy. If your cat has any pre-existing health condition, or is overweight, it is especially important to take her to the vet.  You will need to increase the amount of food you provide for her as the pregnancy progresses. Your vet can advise you on how to go about this in detail, but switching to kitten food in the third trimester is generally advised. The vet will be able to give you an estimate of the number of kittens your cat is expecting. It is possible that the vet will determine that the pregnancy could endanger your cat, and may decide that spaying her is the safest thing to do. It's essential that you provide a safe, warm and quiet area for her to give birth. You should have this birthing nest set up and ready to go at least a week before she is due. Introduce her to the nest early and make sure she knows about it. If she doesn't have a regular bed or box she likes to sleep in, just get a good sized cardboard box and put some warm blankets in it to make it comfortable.  Make sure you only use blankets you don't mind getting soiled. Don't use blankets that have a strong smell.  Place a litter tray near to be box, but not right next to it. Keep the box a couple of feet away. Ensure there is fresh water and food next to the box, but keep the bowls outside of the box. Once you have prepared the nest and the mother, you need to prepare yourself. Gather together all the supplies you might need if there are any problems with the birth. This way you can act quickly and provide the best possible care. Make sure you have plenty of clean and dry towels, which you might need to clean off the kittens. Get some cat-milk powder, and a kitten bottle, in case there is a problem with nursing.  Have a cat box ready to go in case you need to take her to vets in a hurry. Keep the phone number of your vet handy. If there is a problem call up your vet for advice on how to proceed. Once labour begins you should monitor the mother closely. Stay nearby, but don't get too close. Don't invade her personal space, but being in the same room will let her know you are around and can help reassure her. You should be aware of certain warning signs that could indicate a problem with the birth. Knowing these will help you react quickly, so you can contact your vet is there are complications. There could be a problem if:  Half an hour after abdominal contractions have started, no kittens have been born. Half an hour has gone by since the birth of a kitten, the contractions are continuing, but there is no indication of another kitten on the way. A kitten has become stuck halfway during birth. In this case you may be able to apply some gentle pressure to the kitten, but if it doesn't move easily and immediately, contact a vet straight away.

Twist the light bulb gently to tighten it in position. If the bulb moved noticeably, plug in the lights and see if a loose connection was causing the issue. Assuming the bulb is still out, continue to the next step. If you have many lights, buy a string of bulbs of the same brand and type. Keep it in storage and twist off the bulbs to use as replacements when you need them. If you don't have any replacements, take along the burnt-out bulbs to a hardware store, pharmacy, or home improvement store. Look for bulbs that match as closely as possible. Ideally, check the packaging your lights came in to see what type of bulb is needed. Some bulbs are flashers, and when installed, will cause lights to flash on and off. There is no need to have two flashers on the same circuit, as they may cause unusual on / off timings. Use your thumb and index finger to delicately put pressure on each of the broken light's plastic base, to remove the fragile bulbs. If you have a Christmas light repair tool, it may come with a small grip for this purpose.  In order to remove a broken Christmas bulb from its socket, find the two copper wires that sit on the base of the old bulb, noting their position on the base. Push both of the copper wires down, so that they are pointing towards your floor, and the bulb is pointing towards the ceiling. Pull upward on the bulb, and it should now be separated from the light's base. Make sure the two copper wires are completely aligned with the holes in the bulb's base. Once the bulb is fully seated in the base, fold the copper wires against the base in the same position as noted above. Plug in your lights and watch them glow. If you used a continuity/voltage detector tool, and your lights still won't turn on, use the tool again. There may be a second burned-out bulb. These tools can only detect one burned out bulb at a time. If a new bulb still won't light up, your socket may be corroded or the wire may be damaged nearby. Removing this is not as difficult as it sounds, although each bulb you remove will cause the remaining bulbs to burn more brightly and therefore burn out sooner though removing one or two bulbs should be fine. (Note that a damaged wire or a repair using this method, unless done well, may present an electric shock or fire hazard. If you don't feel comfortable removing light bulb sockets, then you can just leave a light bulb in the socket or cover it with electric tape to prevent an electric shock.) Follow this method:  Unplug the lights. Using wire cutters, cut the wire on either side of the broken socket. (Do not cut the other two wires.)

Following and understanding the commodities market can be (and is for many) a full-time job requiring knowledge and expertise. If you do not have the time or inclination, hire a financial advisor to help you. The simplest way to invest in commodities is to just buy the actual item itself and hope that the price increases. This introduces the additional costs of storage and shipping that come with holding a physical asset. This is generally only done with precious metals, like gold or silver, because they are smaller relative to their value. These metals are bought and sold both in coin and bullion form. One way to reduce your costs in trading physical precious metals is to use a remote gold dealing and storage. Several bullion firms offer online trading and safe storage of precious metals. If you're unsure of the legitimacy of a bullion firm, always check the World Gold Council's website first. Commodities have traditionally been traded in the futures market. Futures, which allow an investor to trade contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a set date for a set price, carry a large amount of risk. Because these securities are often highly leveraged (paid for using borrowed money to increase earning potential), a small change in the price of the commodity can result in massive losses (sometimes even more than your initial deposit) or massive gains. In many cases, commodity futures trading is best left to professional traders and large corporations. Buying stocks to related to certain commodities is a way to bet on the value of a commodity without incurring all of the risk of futures trading. For example, if you want to invest in oil, you could buy stock in companies that drill, search for, transport, or sell oil. However, be advised that these stocks, while correlated with commodity prices, may not move directly with them. For example, if the commodity price jumps 10%, this does not necessarily mean that the related stock price will also jump 10%. Exchange traded funds (or ETF's) are funds with shares that trade like stocks, allowing investors to easily buy into a more diversified portfolio of other securities. In the case of commodities, ETF's are generally comprised of futures contracts that track the value of a commodity. This allows the investor to invest directly in fluctuations of the commodity price without the risk of actually holding futures contracts. Mutual funds cannot invest directly in commodities future, but can hold a variety of commodity-related stocks. This is basically just like investing in a large number of commodity-related stocks yourself, except for the fact that the mutual fund is professionally managed. Additionally, some index funds invest in commodities futures. This allows for a mutual fund-type approach with more exposure to actual commodity prices.", "output": "Prenez des conseils.

However, it may be worth checking if you're doing everything else right and the ammonia levels are still not dropping.  Use the ammonia testing kit you would use for the fish tank on your tap water. If the ammonia levels are high in your tap water, talk to a representative from your municipal water district. Decomposing material inside the tank is one of the biggest causes of high ammonia levels. By evaluating the contents of your tank's water, you'll have a clearer idea of what needs to be done to correct the problem.  Any decomposing organic matter, including aquatic plants and microorganisms, can cause a spike in ammonia levels as protein breaks down. Uneaten food can also cause spikes in ammonia levels as it breaks down in the water.  Scoop out any matter that shouldn't be in the tank promptly. Make sure you maintain your tank's regular schedule for changing or partially changing the water. If you see a lot of fish waste floating around in your tank, it could be the source of your elevated ammonia levels.

Take 1000 mg of vitamin C every hour for six hours. Then take 1000 mg three times a day until you don't feel your symptoms anymore. Vitamin D3 is an important vitamin that stimulates the immune system. If you are not already taking vitamin D3 supplements regularly, there is a high probability that you may be deficient in vitamin D. This could be measured with 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels.

However, this doesn't mean you can't be an immense help. If you see, hear, or otherwise observe anything that makes you think theft is taking place, talk to a supervisor immediately. Don't stay silent — keep in mind, according to many workplace's rules, allowing another employee to steal can mean implicating yourself in the crime. At many workplaces, especially ones where there is a major gulf between low-level employees and the management staff or where the employees are unhappy with their jobs, there may be a \"culture of silence\" surrounding the act of workplace theft — that is, thieving employees expect others to cover for them and may use bullying or shunning to punish employees who speak out. In this case, don't ruin your relationship with your fellow employees by going directly to a boss while you're at work. Instead, contact your boss via email, over the phone, or with one of the anonymous methods below. Unfortunately, at some workplaces, it may be ill-advised to earn yourself a reputation as the sort of person who reports workplace theft. In this case, try to report the theft anonymously. This way, the management can deal with the theft, but other employees won't be able to trace your actions back to you. Options you may want to consider include:  Slipping an anonymous note under your boss's door Writing information on an anonymous feedback card Sending your boss an email from a \"throwaway\" email account (one that you make and use only once) Meeting your boss outside of work to discuss the problem If you see an opportunity to document an act of workplace theft with your own notes, pictures, or video footage, you may do so, but be careful. If the employee committing the theft notices you documenting him, he'll probably stop immediately and won't act out around you again, potentially making it harder for you to prove that he's stolen in the long run. In a worst-case scenario, you may even find yourself labeled a \"snitch\" and have your relationship with the other employees damaged. Note that, often, it's enough to make a mental note of when and where the theft occurred and who was involved. If your boss considers you to be trustworthy and your information matches discrepancies in your employer's records, your boss may have enough information to act on even without pictures, videos, or other extra evidence. Employees have a duty to talk to their employers if and when they have information relating to workplace theft. However, they should not accuse other employees of theft when there isn't any sort of conclusive evidence to support their claims. In addition, even if there is evidence that an employee has been stealing, they should not attempt to humiliate the thief in front of other employees or customers. Not only can these sorts of unsupported accusations be very embarrassing if they're proven wrong, but they can also have a negative effect on company morale by promoting a feeling that employees are subject to \"witch hunts\" at a moment's notice.", "output": "Si vous remarquez quelque chose de suspect, parlez-en à votre patron.

Fish naturally release nitrogen into the water, making their \"waste\" water an important source of nutrients for plants. Instead of dumping it down the toilet, use it to water your plants once a week. Fish waste, as well, contains trace elements important for plant growth. Mix coffee grounds with leafy yard waste for \"quick compost,\" especially for acid-loving plants. Mix your coffee grounds with an equal amount of dead leaves, pine straw, and other brown yard clippings and sprinkle over the soil once a month. Roses, azaleas, hydrangeas, and many other plants crave a low pH soil and will respond particularly well. This method isn't just for acid-loving plants -- any gardener can use it to add nitrogen, simply cutting back to once every two months in order to protect the soil from a pH swing. Spread old eggshells over your garden, or in the bottom of planting holes, for a calcium boost. Plants like tomatoes and peppers particularly love calcium, but your whole garden will enjoy eggshells. Calcium, which is over 90% of an eggshell's makeup, helps a plant develop strong cell walls. To use eggshells, lightly crush up the shells and spread over the garden. You can till them into the soil or leave them right on top -- they decompose very quickly. Make a \"nutrient tea\" with grass clippings from your yard. Use the bag on your lawnmower to keep the clippings the next time you cut the grass. Use them to fill up a 5-gallon bucket roughly 2/3s of the way to the top, then fill it near the top with water. Stir it quickly, then let it sit for three days, stirring once each morning. When done, strain out the grass clippings and use your \"tea\" to water your plants, providing essential nitrogen, by mixing it with an equal amount of water and spraying over the plants. While it may seem gross, urine is a free, nitrogen-rich option for fertilizing plants. While most people are understandably squeamish about storing their own urine, it is high in essential nitrogen. To make the process more palatable, fill a bucket with sawdust and pee into this, dumping a large cup of water over it after you're done. You can then use this nutrient-rich mulch when planting your next batch of plants.  Because urine can contain pathogens, you may want to sanitize it by keeping it at a temperature above 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20° Celsius) for at least 30 days.  If you don't mind going \"to the source,\" you can dilute your urine with 10-20 times the amount of water and use it to water your plants directly. Straight urine is too concentrated for plants to handle. Note that you can water this down significantly -- up to 20 parts water for 1 part urine, so it doesn't smell foul. Wood ash is high in calcium and potassium, making it an excellent supplement to your soil. Simply spread it right over the garden, using your hands to lightly turn it into the top layer of the soil.  Vegetables, in particular, tend to love ash, as it promotes healthy root growth.  Warning: Do not use fireplace ashes on plants that love acidic soil like blueberries, roses, or azaleas. Cut up banana peels and add them to the hole when planting. Banana peels don't do much once the plant is already in the ground, but it can work wonders as you're planting. The peels contain a lot of potassium, which promotes a plant's root development. Cut up half a banana peel and toss it in the bottom of your hole before adding the plant. . Composting at home is easy, so you can turn all of your old food scraps, leaves, and plant clippings into food for your garden. When organic matter decays, it releases nutrients that can enrich your soil. You can build your own compost in your yard, or you can try one of the commercially-available kitchen compost units. Take a sample of your soil for testing to fine-tune your fertilizer options. The only way you can tailor your fertilizer effectively is if you know what the soil already contains. The steps above list many different household fertilizers, as well as their essential nutrients, allowing you to make a garden-specific program. You can get home testing kits, or you can bring your sample into a local garden store or county extension office for analysis. When pulling up a soil sample, follow the directions on the kit. If nothing is provided:  Use clean, plastic shovels and a well-cleaned bucket. Dirty or metal implements can introduce other minerals and nutrients. Dig a hole 4-6\" deep, placing the dirt in the bucket. Do not include mulch or trimmings. Repeat with 4-5 holes, mixing together in a bucket. Dry the soil on newspaper for 12-24 hours.

Use this information as a guide or ask a local fishing veteran which way the salmon run. Remember your salmon research! These fish prefer overcast days and waters close to 55° Farenheit.  If the weather is against you and you find yourself fishing in bright weather, you should choose a bright lure to fish with. Darker weather can benefit from darker lures. Maybe you plan on starting with bank fishing and then meeting up with friends to troll fish by boat later in the day. Certain lures work better for certain techniques, and you may also need specific equipment to switch up your style. It'll be difficult for you to go float fishing if you don't have a bobber! Expert anglers recommend fishing for salmon early in the morning, dusk, or evening hours. It's true, you can catch salmon at any time of day, but salmon are generally more active during these times. A holding area is a spot along the migration route where salmon slow down or stop before continuing upstream. These areas are ideal to fish for salmon, because the fish will be plentiful and they will all be focused on eating instead of migrating. Salmon are attracted to bright colors, so use lures and bait that will catch the attention of the fish and make them want to bite.

Otherwise, razor burn will definitely be an issue. There's really no such thing as using too much lubricant, so go ahead and lather up the entire area. Keep the bottle nearby in case you need more.  As you shave, keep applying more cream or body wash to make the process go more smoothly. You may want to rinse it away every once in a while to see how much progress you have made, then reapply to keep shaving. Experts say that shaving in the same direction of hair growth results in less skin irritation. Use one hand to hold the skin in the area completely tight, since this helps the razor do its job effectively. With the other hand, start shaving away the hair, applying just a little pressure for a nice close shave. Keep going until you've shaved the entire area you planned to clear.  Some people start shaving under the belly button, others start with the groin area. It is completely up to you; do whatever makes the job easier for you. Some people find it more difficult to get a close shave when they shave in the direction as hair growth instead of going against the grain. If you're finding it hard to take the hair off, try going at the hair sideways. As a last resort go against the grain. There are other measures you can take to prevent skin irritation. Do not over-shave. There is no need to go over the same spot after you have taken off the hair. If the area is hair-free, let it be so you do not risk irritating the skin. (If you're satisfied you got everything, don't worry about this step, but if this is your first time shaving your bikini area you might want to double check to see if you like the results). Put on your bikini bottoms and check yourself out, then get back in the shower and shave any parts you might have missed.

Let your hormones take control from time to time, and show her that she is the object of your animal urges.

This is a great way to flirt, and it can also break the touch barrier if you're in a new relationship. You don't need to come up with a reason to hold her hand; if you feel it, do it. Even if you are upset, or stressed out, or thinking about something else: take the time to be present and smile a lot in her presence.

It's likely that you'll first be recommended specific aluminum-based topical treatments, but there are a variety of other more aggressive treatments available, if the situation is severe.  In some cases, an oral anticholinergic such as Rubinol will be recommended, which helps to curb sweating, particularly in the underarms. Talk to your doctor about onabotulinumtoxina injections. This treatment method is minimally invasive, and supposedly effective, offering an average efficacy rate of six-eight months. This type of electrotherapy involves, typically, two to four 20-minute sessions per week. Water is used to conduct a small electric current on your skin, which can help to reduce sweating for several weeks or months. While the treatment has mixed results and is somewhat uncomfortable, it's effective in about 70% of cases for armpits.

Use a mild soap or cleaner to avoid drying your skin out. Pat your skin dry. You may want to apply a makeup primer at this point to help all of your makeup adhere to your skin. The stick form of concealer is preferable as it applies the most evenly and hides blemishes well.  Use a liquid foundation and blend it well. Make sure your concealer and foundation are the right shade for your skin tone.  The wrong tone can make your skin look washed out, yellow or orange. Use a foundation brush to apply your foundation for the most even application and polished look. Use blush sparingly, as the Emo look focuses on the eyes and less on the colors of the skin and lips.  If you are going for a pale look then try not to use blush as the goal of Emo makeup is to accentuate the eyes. Keep the shade only slightly pinker than your skin tone. Apply in circles to the cheekbones. Avoid putting blush on contours or cheek hollows. Use a smokey eye effect.  Start by applying a matte slade shade of eyeshadow across the eyelid. Add a small touch of black eyeliner towards the outer 1/3 of the eyelid. Blend the darker eyeshadow to create a smokey effect. Since Emo make up is typically dark and heavy, make sure to get a lot of black makeup.  For eyeliner, get a black eyeliner pencil. Apply black eyeliner on the lash line. Extend the eyeliner a little bit on both sides of the eye and inner and outer corner to create a 2-way jacketed effect. Thicken the eyeliner. Go over the eyeliner again until you are satisfied with it. Make sure the eyeliner ends meet up at the corners of your eyes. On the outside, the effect should be somewhat catlike, with the line slanting upwards towards your temples. You can do this using a sponge applicator.   Define the edges of the eyeliner with a liquid eyeliner for a smooth effect. You can also add a coloured eyeliner here if you want to add some more vibrancy. Repeat the eyeliner application on your top lashes. Try to keep the eyeliner consistently smooth on both the top and bottom lash lines. Remember, the eyes are the focus of the Emo look, so it is important to emphasize the eyelashes.  Take care not to smudge mascara onto the eyelid when applying. Some people apply mascara to their lower lashes, too. Take care when doing this as it can smudge easily. For a more dramatic effect, use false eyelashes. Use these carefully as applying eyelash glue can be challenging and you are working close to your eye. You want to focus to be on your eyes so don't overdo it with the lips.  Be sure to use a lip moisturizer such as lip balm. This helps your look to not wear away as fast, so you don't have to re-applicate it often. Avoid dark or bright colors on the lips, as that is more a trend with Gothic style makeup. A light lip color in a slightly pink or natural shade is best for the Emo style.

This will look the most natural if you forego eyeshadow and just do a liner and it won't alter the shade of your eyeshadow by adding pigmentation.  If you're doing a smokey eye or a dark eyeshadow, look for a darker primer to add depth to your look. If you are using multiple colors and really want them to pop, try a white primer. You can also use a clear primer for the most versatile option. Since primer is a base to even out your skin tone, it should really be matte or transparent, rather than shimmery.  Consider color correcting primer if you have dark circles or want to brighten your eyes. Primers with a yellow or peach cast will neutralize the purples, browns, and \"bruise\" shades of under eye circles. A primer with a little bit of green can neutralize pink or reddish skin. Matte primers are great for everyday use, because they tend to last longer and give you a more neutral base for your eye makeup. Even if your skin is not oily, eyelids tend to get a little greasy throughout the day, and the matte finish will help absorb the grease and keep your makeup in place.  A satin or shimmery finish works when you are wearing no shadow over your primer or plan to use a sparkly eyeshadow. Keep in mind these don't have quite the staying power as a matte primer, and that you shouldn't use a matte eyeshadow over a shimmery primer or it will look off.  If you have very dry skin, try a gel-based primer or one that illuminates skin.  Matte primers work with both matte and shimmery eyeshadows--they allow you to add all the shine using the makeup, not the primer.  Matte primers are especially effective in hot and humid weather, because it will keep the grease and shine under control. Primers come in gel, cream, liquid, or stick form. The texture of your primer will influence how it feels on your lids and how long it will last. Gel primers usually last the longest and can be worn with all types of eyeshadow. They're great in hot weather and minimizing creasing.  Cream primers have a mousse texture and are the easiest to find. They work with most eyeshadows and can feel a little heavier on your lids. Liquid primers are very lightweight, but are prone to showing creases if applied too lightly. Make sure you thoroughly blend liquid primers into the creases of your eyelids when applying.  Stick primers can be applied directly to your eyelid, instead of using your finger or a brush. They are very convenient for this reason, however it can be difficult to gauge how much primer you are applying. or use a natural alternative if you run out of your primer. Aloe vera gel or unscented and unflavored Milk of Magnesia can substitute for primer in a pinch. Both will absorb excess oil, and the aloe can actually moisturize your eyelid as well.

Try to join a few that don't overlap – that way you'll meet the most people and develop a wide variety of interests. One idea is to join one of every kind of activity: one athletic, one academic, and one artistic. You could be on the basketball team, on the school newspaper, and in choir. It'll look good on your college resume, too. Try to identify who's where on the \"social ladder.\" It's not that big of a deal (being cool is about being liked, which is different than being popular), but it will help you know how to identify with people. What are the cool kids like? Are they jocks, are they smart, are they rebels? How about the mid-crowd? Do they follow along or sort of do their own thing? And the lowest tier, what about them? With whom in which groups do you want to be friends with? It's a good idea to be friends with people on all rungs of the ladder – you never know where you'll end up. If you do want to be popular, it's a good idea to befriend one of the nicer popular people; they'll be your ticket into \"the group.\" Just make sure you don't abuse people on your way up. Sometimes friends don't work out, and then the rejects won't even want you later when you need a friend. Being cool doesn't necessarily mean you're popular. There are plenty of \"popular\" kids that are mean and not actually liked. Being one of them won't get you anywhere. Instead, aim to be popular and cool by having people legitimately like you. To do that, just be friendly and nice to everyone you meet. Why would you do anything else, right? You probably have a pretty good grip on how to be friendly. The only thing to keep in mind is to be friendly to those people that you think aren't cool. Give them help when you sense they need it. Say hi in the hallways if you know them. You never know – they could be the next cool kid in a few months' time. Just because you're trying to move into the cooler crowd, you shouldn't leave your old friends behind. If you try to ditch them, the people you want to join will know — and no one wants to be friends with that type of person. Make new ones in addition to the old. You can spend ages on your hair/makeup and just say that it takes \"one comb through.\" They will admire you because it would take them hours while it takes you 5 or 10 minutes. They will want to be like you, but don't keep mentioning or bragging about it. Just about every adult will tell you that when you grow up, you'll realize that being cool doesn't really matter and if they would've known that being cool is about not trying, they wouldn't have stressed so much. Though it's easier said than done, try to relax a little. If you're trying too hard, it's a turnoff and people won't think you're confident and that you don't like yourself. And if you don't like yourself, why should they? Here's an example: let's say this person you don't really know asks you out on a date. You say no. Then, they start sending you love letters. You still say no. Then flowers. Next thing you know, they're outside your door at night. They are trying really, really hard. Is it working? No. In fact, it's the opposite of working. You wish they had a little self-respect and you just want them to go away. Try your best to not care about what you think other people think of you. Just go with the flow. Why? Because not everyone is going to like you. No one is liked by everyone because we all have flaws and we all have different personalities. If you know for sure someone is judging you, you can voice it, then just act like you don't care, because you don't. Practice thinking this way and your confidence will improve via self-acceptance. People at school will start wondering where you got all this self-esteem! This is where style comes into play. The skaters have their style, the plastics have their style, the nerds have their style, etc. We're all different and nothing is necessarily better than anything else. If someone is judging you, they're caught up in their small, closed mind. They're not going anywhere anyway, so don't get on the friend train with them. It's a one-way ticket to a dead end. Don't be mean to other people in your school just to make yourself seem cooler. In fact, people generally hate bullies, they're just too scared to admit it to their faces. In time, the bullies lose their power and then they're left with nothing. It may be tempting now, but in the long run it will only do you harm.  Don't spread gossip or start rumors. Don't make negative comments. Just because you don't like someone, or something they've done, doesn't mean you need to voice that. Don't exclude others. After all, you're reading this because you want people to like you. It's easier said than done, but in school, using your sense of humor and your good social tactics are the key.

In the United States, dry milk labeled \"extra grade\" has passed certain taste and quality tests.  Whole milk powder can be difficult to find in stores. You may need to order it online. Start by mixing the dry milk with cold water. You can follow the instructions on the package, or use this approach (for one liter / one quart milk):  Mix 315mL (1⅓ cups) instant dry milk into 500mL (2 cups) cold water until dissolved. Add in another 500 mL (2 cups) water and stir until well mixed. Let stand a few minutes and stir again. For regular dry milk, use 175mL (¾ cup) of the powder instead. Dissolve it in a small amount of hot water before adding to the cold water. Mixing nonfat dry milk with an equal amount of whole milk gives you a result roughly equivalent to 2% milk. If you buy dry milk for shelf life reasons, use UHT (\"ultra high temperature\") milk, which can last unopened for six months at room temperature. If you buy dry milk to save money, use ordinary milk and mix in as much as your budget allows. UHT milk tastes slightly sweeter than regular milk, and not everyone likes the extra flavor. Alone or mixed with real milk, dry milk tastes best cold. If you do not have a refrigerator, wrap the container in a wet towel and put it in a cellar or other cool location. If your milk is lumpy, chill overnight and stir again the next day. Lumpy milk can result from old or poorly stored powder. \"Regular\" (non-instant) powder tends to form lumps even when fresh. After opening a dry milk package, pour the leftover powder into a glass or metal container (plastic can add an unpleasant odor). Seal tightly and store in a dark, dry location.

This is because if these thoughts are not examined and changed, they will carry on despite behavioral changes you are able to make. Some common appearance related assumptions that BDD sufferers hold include: “If people see the real me, then they will be repulsed.\" “If I can see the problem, then everyone else must be noticing it too.” \"If I relax my standards, then I will let myself go.\" \"If I do not look perfect, then no one will ever love me.\" \"If I look attractive, then I will be successful in life.\" \"If I am ugly, then I have no value.\" Many people coping with BDD tend to overestimate the likelihood that others will respond to their appearance in a negative manner, underestimate their ability to cope if this did occur, and discount any information which suggests that things will not be as bad as they predicted. These biases can be corrected just by knowing that they are common mistakes made. For instance, if you are at a social gathering, spend time focusing on how few people have made negative remarks about your appearance and how positively people have responded to your presence at the event or how many times you have been complimented. Even though it can be difficult, dare to play devil's advocate and challenge your own beliefs. Re-consider the way you evaluate your own looks by thinking realistically about others' opinion of you, and about how important appearance is more generally. If you hold beliefs that your appearance dictates your for value as a person, remind yourself of the many qualities that you value in others. Notice that these other qualities are not affected by appearance and that you yourself have the ability to value people aside from how they look. Comparative thinking (i.e. \"Am I more or less beautiful than __?\") is one of the main ways that we develop unrealistic expectations for ourselves. By fully exploring the qualities and sparks that are uniquely \"you\", it will be much more difficult to focus on what you don't have. This can be especially difficult considering the fact that many BDD sufferers receive frequent reassurance about their appearance that seems to have no impact.", "output": "Faites le point sur les croyances que vous avez au sujet de votre apparence de manière froide et objective.

After using the WD-40, make a mixture of one part dish soap and one part water, then dip a clean cloth in the soap solution and dab at the area to remove the WD-40.  WD-40 generally does not stain, but if you are worried about it further staining your carpet, spray test an inconspicuous area of carpet with a small amount of WD-40, then let it sit for about five minutes. If you do not notice any discoloration, it is safe to use. Brake cleaner is another product that is not designed as a stain remover, but can do a great job breaking down and lifting tar stains.

The client will then connect to other computers that have the same torrent file and begin downloading the actual game files to your computer. The more people that are sharing the file, the faster that you will be able to download it. You can download highly compressed versions of games from various websites, but this isn't recommended as they've often been stripped of lots of assets to make the file size smaller. With hard drive storage becoming cheaper and cheaper, you'll get a better experience getting a full game from a torrent. Torrent trackers are sites that host torrent files. You can use torrent trackers like search engines to find the exact game that you are looking for. The easiest way to find torrent trackers is to simply search for \"torrent tracker\" using your favorite search engine. Most trackers you'll find through Google are public trackers that anyone can use. If you do some digging, you'll likely come across private trackers. These may allow you to find harder-to-find games, as well as stay out of the spotlight. Private trackers typically require invites from existing users, and almost always make members upload as much as they download. Use the torrent tracker to search for the game that you want to download. If it is a more recent release, you'll likely find several options in the search results list. If the game is older, there may only be one or two options, or the game might not be available on that tracker. It is illegal to download a game that you don't own in most areas. The first thing that you want to look at in the results list is the number of \"Seeders\". These are users that have the complete file and are sharing it with others. Not only do more seeders lead to a faster speed, but more users generally indicates that the file works. This is especially important with games, as many are designed with copyright protections to prevent users who didn't purchase the game from playing. You'll want to make sure that the torrent includes all of the files you'll need to play the game, including any cracks for bypassing copyright protection.

Give yourself at least a few days to consider your feelings and follow some of the advice in this article. If you act too soon, you may find your feelings about your crush change over time.  Ask yourself questions like these: \"Do I have a true romantic crush on this boy, or just an infatuation?\" \"What things do I like about this guy?\" \"What outcome do I want?\" If you can't answer these questions, try to get to know him better before proceeding. Only you will know whether you truly like someone. However, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, you can try taking an online quiz and interpreting the results as you please. No matter how cute your crush is, he's still a human being! He's probably as nervous as you are about discussing who he likes. Similarly, even if it's not apparent yet, he probably has plenty of flaws. Don't get too emotionally invested in a relationship that hasn't even started! If you're having a hard time thinking of your crush as anything other than a perfect Adonis, try to mentally note things about him, however small, that make him look silly or stupid! Does he have a tiny bald spot? Does he pronounce \"epitome\" as \"ep-it-tome?\" Recognizing that everyone has flaws will make even the cutest guys much more approachable. Does he seem to pay special attention to you? Does he smile a lot around you? Or, on the other hand, does he tease you and try to playfully ignore you? These are all signs that a guy might like you. If you can identify possible attraction cues, you'll have a much easier time telling him you like him because you'll already have an idea of how he feels! A guy's body language can reveal his inner emotions. Does he position his chest and shoulders toward you, even if his attention is momentarily occupied by something else? Does he seem to make eye contact with you a lot? He may be pondering how to tell a girl he likes her! Despite your best preparations, he might not return your interest. Acknowledge this as a possibility and try not to worry about it - if he says no, it's not because he hates you. He just doesn't currently want to date you. This can be for any number of reasons. Don't let him see that his negative response bothers you ( even if it does).  He may be reeling from a messy breakup. He may be too emotionally immature to pursue a relationship. He may simply enjoy being single. In the past, it was scandalous for women to ask men out. Today, much of the stigma has disappeared. However, many women still are hesitant to ask men out.

You could ask the therapist about their training, or about whatever else feels important to you to know (for example, do they have experience working with people of your ethnicity/sexual orientation, etc.). You're essentially acting as an employer who is giving a job interview, and you're going to determine whether you want to hire this therapist as a consultant. Keep this idea in mind during each call.  Ask the therapist about how they handle conflict: therapists who are able to repair the rupture in the relationship when there is conflict tend to have a better outcome than their conflict-avoidance colleagues. Pay attention to how you feel when you talk with the therapist. If it doesn't feel like a good fit for you, don't make an appointment with that person even if you can't give a logical explanation about why you don't feel good about that person. Trust your feelings. Try to see if the therapist that you like has any patient or client testimonials that relate to the condition that you have. If your therapist does not have a results or testimonials page check to see if other clients or patients wrote testimonials on another website like Yelp.com Compare your findings to the tips and warnings below. Do they return your phone call in a timely manner? Do you like the way that they talk to you? Do you feel relatively comfortable talking to them about what is going on with you?  When a therapist seems warm, personable, intelligent, and knowledgeable, and doesn't display any of the warning signs below, consider hiring that person. Different countries and states require therapists to hold different licenses and certificates to practice, so you will have to check whether your therapist holds the appropriate license for your area. Holding a valid license for therapy helps ensure that the therapist has met in-depth educational requirements, is up-to-date in their training, and is held to a code of ethics and practice in dealing with patients. If you're paying out of pocket for therapy, make sure you can afford the hourly rates. If you're relying on health insurance to pay for your therapy, make sure that the therapist choices you're considering accept payments from your insurance company. While financial matters shouldn't restrict your ability or drive to get good therapy, you still need to consider how you're going to pay the therapist (if you don't have sessions provided by your insurance or a national/local medical care system). Do your research before matching with the given therapist so that you don't find yourself back at square one if you determine that the financial relationship won't work. Once you have interviewed all the prospective therapists, take some time to think about the best choice. If you plan on using insurance, call your insurance company to be sure that the therapist you like is covered, or if that therapist will provide 'out of network provider' statements to you. It's important to bear in mind that some problems will take longer to resolve than others, so treatment duration can vary considerably. But if you notice absolutely no change in your problem after the first couple of months, hire a different therapist.", "output": "Contactez les thérapeutes qui vous ont été recommandés.
